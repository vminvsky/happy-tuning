The right and libertarians have scared people in this country to the point where, in the face of a crisis of people not having any money, they are scared of inflation.\n\nWhen everybody is losing their jobs, they don't have money to spend. Can you go overboard? Of course, but paying out a couple a month for a limited amount of time isn't going to do it. Plus we could, you know, tax corporations and actually make them pay their fair share. That way you could have UBI and not have to print any more money.

Yeah, right.\n\nMain message: While I would certainly accept the money (and I feel that there are others who really need and should get the money) I'm a little concerned for the long term ramifications. It seems like the risk of inflation could make it harder for people who have it hard. Perhaps it should be slightly less and breaking off more gradually and earlier? 1.5k per adult &amp; 500 per kid,dropping to 1k\/300 for people making more than 40k, 500\/100 for people over 60k.

Currently Hungarian society considers work as the only moral way to earn money and unemployed people who live off benefits are looked down upon.\n\nThere's the New Testament saying [\"He who does not work, neither shall he eat\"](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/He_who_does_not_work,_neither_shall_he_eat). This saying is very well known in Hungary and every child learns it.\n\nSo UBI is seen as unjust and unnatural for most people.\n\nI personally think that it will be necessary if we want to keep living in some democracy-like system. Otherwise we'll have a ruling elite and very poor commoners who won't have any means of acquiring money from the ruling class. Currently the elite needs the common people as workforce and is therefore willing to pay them out of necessity. If the pay is too low, workers have the option to strike. This all disappears once large-scale automation kicks in. It will bring very deep social change for sure. With UBI, we will have to rethink our values, without UBI, it will be shit for most people.\n\nMain message: What do you think about universal income ?",

So, are policies which are aimed at reducing the harmful effects of markets (rent taxes (not just land), bans on inputs to production, carbon rations, national ownership of various industries which tend toward oligopoly or which are better on a bigger scale, UBI\/UBS - to enable degrowth, incompatible with widespread markets etc) compatible with anarchism?\n\nthis is the probably the most contentious question of all quotations posed by anarchists. and there's really no consensus so the answer is down to the individual. (j\/k the answer is no)\n\nsome anarchists do not participate in electoral politics at all. the reasons can vary from living in areas where voting at all means voting for people who actively want to do you harm to not wanting to give the state any legitimacy. most anarchist spaces are explicit in barring conversations that promote electoralism because as a practice democracy is not compatible with anarchism. \n\nanarchists that do vote are split into two camps I've found. first are the folks that participate in local elections, supporting progressive and radical candidates to help build less harmful communities.  \n\nthen there are folks who lose their entire minds every four years to demand that everyone vote for the lesser of two evils because this one evil wants your oppressors to be nice.

It is imperative to win back the Senate (Georgia election), at least so that Biden can do something for the economy.\n\n- why is adopting that aspect of the Scandinavian model critical to the success of the entire models implementation\n\nSimple. If the tax income brackets is too sharp between the haves &amp; have nots, they WILL be more motivated to do tax evasions. I'll say my ideal personal income tax rates are 20-50% (20 for lower class, 25 for lower middle, 30 for middle, 35 for upper middle, 40 for upper class but not that wealthy, 45 &amp; 50% for the types of ultra wealthy Warren wants to be taxed). But no wealth tax, no corporate income tax (better to introduce high VAT taxes but increase everyone's wages, like 1. 5 times. (To me, minimum wage = 50% of the state \/ city's median income for singles). Avoiding tax evasions).\n\nPlus, I'm OK with poor people being taxed like 20%. Why? It's a market pressure to formalize their jobs (making sure that their jobs are formal, registered, taxed and protected welfare state, etc. There should be a law to regulate gig economy &amp; contract workers, no making them employees are kinda stupid but there should be a regulation).\n\nThe key is really at the programs, and making people feel (or really are) that their tax money is really circulated. Free education, free healthcare, free childcare, UBI (I prefer UBI than food stamps, TANF, etc. But it should never get rid of Medicare &amp; Social Security - I'm the type of person who'll say get rid of Medicaid but put actual, present day Medicare for everyone, then gov controls drug &amp; procedure prices, then use individually chosen private insurance as complement), etc.\n\nSocial democratic programs HAS TO BE universal (for everyone). Currently, American welfare system is means tested \/ for people below certain income only. Well, that means people who are just above that won't get it. You know, people who are just above the poverty line? Labor laws for employees, well what about contract workers &amp; gig economy? Some prefer being a contract worker.\n\nThat's the logic behind free college too, even if in the US it's a bailout for the middle class.\n\nFor me, it's better to target activities where rich people do it more (eg. 20% transfer tax to foreign banks per transfer to prevent them from evading taxes in foreign countries) than simply raise income taxes.\n\nMain message: &gt;Yeah, good luck doing that in a country with political gridlock.\n\nThis argument could be used against trying literally anything during a time of political gridlock, which is obviously an absurd and unsustainable notion. The government needs to do certain functions for our society to be healthy and prosperous, but in order to force the government to Preform those functions we need to fight through the gridlock, because if we don't then a tremendous number of people which did not otherwise need to suffer from poverty, homelessness, and\/or a lack of access to education or medical care will suffer tremendously from such calamities.\n\nFor the good of the American people these reforms are necessary, even if they will be damn near impossible to implement.\n\n&gt;The logic behind social democracy taxation is NOT the logic behind, say, US taxation scheme. Even flat income taxes are A-OK to them.\n\nOK, but why is adopting that aspect of the Scandinavian model critical to the success of the entire models implementation? Why could we not just use a more stratified system of taxation to minimize (or even eliminate) the burden which taxes places on those who would be least capable of paying such taxes, and who's money would do the most good in the economy if not taxed away.",

Instead our government should pay for remote infrastructure through offering those utilities to everyone else in more dense population centers. \n\nThen in terms of human necessities (which may include some utilities), those should also be decommodified because the only outcome of deriving profit from housing or basic access to food is to threaten people with suffering to extract more value from them.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into our actual primary industries, which essentially consist of companies taking our natural resources and selling them to other people, while we see nothing from it.\n\nThese things don't belong in a civilized society, we just don't live in a civilized society, we live in one run by robber-baron psychopaths who have no care for other people or our planet.",

    "text":"Comment response: The honest answer - They don't.  Gun crime and violent crime in general are almost non existent for other reasons.  One of the issues people never point out is that when we point at \"other countries gun control works\" we aren't comparing like to like.\n\nGermany has had two major shootings in the last six months - one with a homemade firearm (Halle and Hanau).  Australia homicide\\\\suicide numbers didn't move after their almost total ban on semi-automatic rifles and heavy restriction of other firearms.  Mass casualty events still happen with knives, trucks, or firebombs.  Gun violence was uncommon in Australia before the ban and mass shootings were even rarer.  I focus on Australia because its near total confiscation is being rebranded and sold heavily in the states.\n\nThe reality of it is cultural and economic.  Culturally speaking, crime is a completely different element in those countries, they don't have pervasive gang cultures or major cities in poverty death spirals (like Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, et al).\n\nEconomically speaking they have robust social and health systems that likely alleviate many of the motivators of criminal activity before it starts.  Half of all homicides in fact, gun or otherwise, happen the same poor urban mostly black neighborhoods - that have their own unique economic struggles, joblessness, food\\\\shelter anxieties.\n\n[https:\/\/thenewamerican.com\/john-lott-half-of-all-us-murders-happen-in-just-2-percent-of-us-counties\/](https:\/\/thenewamerican.com\/john-lott-half-of-all-us-murders-happen-in-just-2-percent-of-us-counties\/)\n\nFinally, most violence is executed by repeat offenders, only about 3% of the US population will ever commit a a felony offense, and even fewer of those will ever commit a gun crime.  Those incidents of violent crime have dropping every year for decades.\n\nAlso - least we forget, 65% of all gun deaths are suicides.  Taking the gun from them isn't a solution...\n\nDo you think it makes sense to take property from the overwhelming majority of legal, law abiding gun owners, because the same violent criminals commit acts of murder as if it were any other day?  There are 120 Million gun owners in the US and on average those of us who carry concealed commit fewer crimes than the police.\n\nFinal note - I think Andrew Yangs UBI would have done more to solve gun crime than any gun control measure you could imagine.\n\nMain message: Genuine question,  then why do gun laws work in every other first world country?",

No one would care about working for like 9 dollars an hour..when they get 1,000 per month anyway.   Employers would then not have enough workers and would have to either raise wages to entice workers - or - move to AI to automate as much stuff as they can that doesn't require much intelligence or skill.   Which as that is still 5 or 10 years away - would create a massive upheaval in the countries labor and workforce, and take a huge amount of power away from corporations.

I don't know, I haven't looked into it that far.\n\nUBI doesn't replace universal health care though, so most medical expenses would still be covered under that, and that helps drastically with someone has any form of disability\/medical condition that prevents them from working.\n\nThe main advantages of UBI over the current system is the lowered overheads of running the system, and ensuing those at risk of poverty under the current system have a liveable amount reducing the stress on these people allowing them to better position them selves to (re)enter the workforce, such as by allowing them to re-train without the threat of becoming homeless.\n\nI am sure there are plenty of nuisances to UBI that I haven't covered and\/or am unaware of, but research has shown its more effective then the current welfare model where is has been tried.\n\nMain message: What does it cost to make life 'liveable' for our most vulnerable in society?\n\n$20k\/yr may be fine for Sarah, who's struggled to find work since her last full time job 18 months ago, but what about her sister Trudy?\n\nI don't imagine $20k\/yr will put much of a dent in Trudy's annual physiotherapy\/OT\/home help budget (required following her traumatic accident 16 years ago leaving her unable to work).\n\nAt face value, a total replacement of the welfare system with UBI *does* make me think it's a bad idea. Perhaps we could have a system where the money tends to go where it's needed most - like mainly to Trudy, a little to Sarah (when she needs it), and none to me. It sounds like the system we currently have in place is closer to that than a UBI.",

Now you send drones and in the future, maybe robots to fight, and they will be produced in a factory like Tesla's, with even more robots. There will be much fewer people in the army as a result. So, a war won't provide an occupation to the jobless.\n\nWhat I think will happen is that many people are going to be forced to form social networks of professionals and cooperatives where they pool the resources they have left together and work directly for their own needs. That would imply farming, building houses, educating children and many more such services, as well as providing for their basic needs. They won't have money to buy products from the industry, so they will have to work in their own interest. There is one employer that won't fire them: themselves.\n\nAs for the industry, without UBI and money recirculation, they will dry out, by losing their market. It's going to be a crisis for them just as much as for people. Some will provide for the government, some will provide for other companies, but when most of the retail sector will crash, who will buy the end products? How will they make a profit? The answer is that automation is irrelevant when it is not in the hands of people. It is no use to produce when people can't buy.\n\nMain message: The US will use war to spur its economy before trying a large government system.

For many recipients, they stand to lose money by working, or the stand to lose time and break even.\n\nThe value of UBI is that you can replace a whole bunch of systems which incentivize failure. If the UBI is actually universal, no matter how much money you make, you'll still get UBI, so you're never dis-incentivized to work harder, get a promotion or whatever. I have a friend who moved out of her former housing situation, and into a low cost housing apt. She was working part time at an entry level. Within 6 months she'd became a assistant manager, and was getting kicked out of her apt for making too much money. This is a clear disincentive, and she had to then pay more money for a new apt. It worked out in the end, but that's not good policy.\n\nIf you provide UBI which ammounts to just below the poverty line, you can ignore everyone and all their problems. If someone can't pull themselves up over the poverty line, fuck em, they're lazy. If they can, they are contributing more to the economy.

    "text":"Comment response: This is why something like UBI needs to happen. You are writing code that replaces other people's work. That is not wrong, and it should be praised.\n\nThe issue is that your employers (in general) would rather pay you less than they paid all the people you've replaced, while hoarding more of the productivity gains for themselves, rather than redistribute the profits through paying higher taxes. We can't even change the laws, because they've invested a tiny percentage of their profits into political gain. While they make billions, a few million goes a long way with influencing political campaigns. That's the basis of the economic inequality you described.\n\nIt's a mess.\n\nMain message: The question is: Why do they HAVE to work?\n\nThere is so much wealth in this country there should not be anyone who's basic needs are not met, at the least.\n\nAutomation is not a new thing, the computer revolution of the 80's and 90's saw massive automation in the increase of efficiency of many different professions. ALL of the benefit of that increased efficiency went to the socioeconomic elite, the owners and shareholders of the corporations. Is that fair? I don't know, I don't think fairness is an objective concept, but I do know it doesn't have to be that way.\n\nThe top 0.1% of Americans hold the same amount of wealth as the bottom 90%... 0.1% ... 90% ... let those numbers sink in.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/americas-top-01-households-hold-same-amount-of-wealth-as-bottom-90-2017-10\n\nThis will continue to get worse as more and more jobs are lost to automation. The natural end result of this is a TINY ruling elite lording over hundreds of millions of subjects... wealth and power naturally consolidate if allowed to do so, that is the natural order, action needs to be taken to prevent it from happening or to reset it. Historically this trend was reset via revolution, usually very violent revolution.\n\nFWIW I am a firmware engineer who writes AI into professional fiber optic test equipment... I have caused people to lose work by making the tools smart enough that the user doesn't have to be.

The problem is, I can also see PR as dividing the country as well (it would surely increase the influence England has through sheer weight of numbers). So I\u2019ve been toying with a reform to split Parliament between the House of Commons (elected via PR) and a house made up of locally elected representatives representing each region of the country with greater local devolution. \n\nI\u2019ve also been considering an independent body to look into any sitting government\u2019s activities for evidence of corruption, thus keeping the ruling party accountable for their actions. \n\nSecondly, social services. This is my big area that I want to tackle because our social services and public sector is a joke right now. For one I\u2019d scrap Universal Credit (I\u2019m not entirely sold on UBI though) or at least reform t seriously (not worked out the specifics of how though). For the NHS I\u2019d look into spending whilst increasing funding to pre-austerity levels with a focus on pay and support for staff, an increase in funding specifically for mental health services as well. Meanwhile, I would look to reduce unnecessary spending in the NHS to cut down on costs. \n\nTo back this up, I\u2019d launch a joint social and educational reform programme. First, I would look to working with local councils to renovate abandoned houses and pass them on cheaply (probably with a loan from the government) to the homeless as part of a societal re-integration programme (with aims to either get them into work or education).Meanwhile, I\u2019d introduce personal finance courses in schools starting at age 16 so kids growing up know a bit more about how to actually work with their finances and can avoid poverty. \n\nIn education, I\u2019d look at reducing or eliminating university fees if practicable but also a general increase in support for primary teaching and a reduced focus on homework and exams at secondary with an increased focus at primary on basic skills, social skills and building community ties. I\u2019d also like to begin a secularisation of the school system, moving away from having so many CoE and religious schools in the country. This isn\u2019t even some \u2018religion is bad\u2019 ideology I\u2019m going with here, my biggest worry is social division caused by having kids divided by religion. The same goes for private schools, I\u2019d look towards reducing their numbers over time so rich and poor students aren\u2019t being artificially divided by wealth. To that end, I\u2019d also scrap grammar schools and the 11+. They\u2019re bullshit enough said. \n\nI have other thoughts but it\u2019s late and I\u2019m tired. \n\nMain message: You are now Prime Minister and your party have all 650 seats in the parliament....",

    "text":"Comment response: https:\/\/futurism.com\/how-traditional-welfare-and-taxes-can-be-reformed-to-support-universal-basic-income\n\nLand-Value Tax (LVT)\nLast but not least, in fact in my opinion most important of all economically in the long-term as a new tax to increasingly replace existing taxes with, is a tax on the unimproved value of land\u200a\u2014\u200aaka land-value taxation or LVT. Not to be confused with property taxes that tax what\u2019s built on land, LVT taxes the total value of real estate minus what\u2019s built on it. The owner of a high-rise apartment building providing homes to hundreds of families would pay the same tax as an identical adjacent lot that stands empty, thus providing a disincentive to idle speculation and an incentive to develop unused and underused space.\n\nThe value of land is perhaps the best example of all of the wealth we all co-create, because the value of land depends entirely on everything and everyone that exists around it, not on it. If all your neighbors burn down their houses, your house will be worth less. If all your neighbors fix up their houses, your house will be worth more. The increase in value is clearly collectively (not individually) generated.\n\nSince the 1980s, housing prices in the US have increased by 5% on average (minus the real estate bubble creation and burst), which means a 5% tax levied on land values and distributed to all as basic income would be distributing the value created by everyone to everyone. It would raise an estimated $750 billion and function as an entirely unavoidable tax on both corporations and individuals alike. It would also serve alongside the VAT as an additional clawback mechanism, where all owners of land totaling more than $265,320 would pay more in LVT than received in basic income.\n\nThis combination would be hugely progressive, not only economically but racially, because the top 10% own 78% of all non-home real estate, and where the median white household has around $76,000 in home value wealth, the median black household has only around $1,500 in home value wealth. In other words, under this plan, median white households (not counting any other taxes but LVT) would potentially be net receivers of $9,466 in basic income and median black households would be net receivers of $12,966 in basic income. For those hoping for a UBI that provides extra as reparations, this plan achieves that by clawing back less from African Americans, not for being African American, but for being systematically excluded from property ownership for centuries.\n\nI like this approach. It takes the historical injustices against fellow Americans into account, without barring anyone from still receiving UBI.\n\nMain message: Yes. As I mentioned in my post, it\u2019s a start since the economic growth under a Yang economy will soon be enough to pay for maybe an additional, reparations based dividend. Maybe start at $1,000 a month to stack on top of the Freedom Dividend for African Americans and adjust the amount after Congress figures out the true cost.",

Because the way a lot of minimum wage jobs work these days it's pretty common to get 25 hours one week, 15 the next, 10 the week after that, and then 20-25 again the week following that one. This change is going to get a lot of poor people that work kicked off of food stamps for something they have no control of. \n\nBut that's not the only problem with this change. What about the homeless? Sure, it says the work requirement is waved for the disabled, which I assume includes people with mental illness, but most homeless people have *undiagnosed* mental illness  so they won't qualify for that waiver.\n\nThen there are single mothers. How is a single mother supposed to go to work when she has no one to watch her kids? Day care is $1000-2000 a child per month, who's going to pay for that?\n\nEvery person that these programs are meant to help, the homeless, single parents, the working poor, are now at risk of losing the only safety net program that is keeping them from starving.\n\nWe should be working towards universal basic income, not cutting the barely there safety net we actually do have.\n\nYou know, there's been a lot of talk recently about why in the US we have such a problem with mental illness. Besides the obvious answer being a lack of healthcare options, my theory is that as Americans, especially those of us who live paycheck to paycheck, we all live under constant stress and fear of what would happen to us and our families if we ever lost our jobs and couldn't find new work fast enough. \n\nThis isn't a big deal in other countries with strong safety nets but in the US you can actually end up homeless and now starve to death too with these changes.\n\nSo it's no wonder we have a mental health crisis in this country. Stress is a common contributor to the development of mental illness and a lot of us Americans live under constant stress of losing our incomes and having no safety net to keep us from losing everything.\n\nOnce again conservatives prove that they put money before people. \n\nMain message: Trump moves to stiffen work requirements for food stamps",

Which is it? If no one works, no one pays taxes. It's plain and simple.

Things like basic income will be a start, but the end goal is no money, just smart and fair share of resources, which we waste incredibly in today's world.

If I had used an undesirable consequence of people having less income than EI currently affords, you may have considered that a feature instead of a bug.\n\n&gt;I don\u2019t really care what the model is, as long as it improves outcomes for people at an acceptable, or lower cost.\n\nWhat people consider an improved outcome will differ. If we eliminate minimum wage, it will be an improved outcome for the rich.\n\n&gt;Any other thing you can come up with, like for some reason a UBI necessitating the privatization of our healthcare system, does not have my endorsement.\n\nThat is exactly my point. If you just go around saying \"UBI is good and can allow us to eliminate some social programs\", others will have their own idea of what UBI means and think you are talking about the same model they are, even if you are not at all. That is why it's reckless.\n\nSince I can tell by this comment that you seem to be more left leaning, I'll try in more partisan terms. Imagine what a UBI by the conservatives would look like. The more people speak in support of a non-specific UBI, the greater the risk of that.\n\nMain message: I\u2019m sorry, but what your doing is building a straw man. Maybe try reading what I\u2019m saying a bit more charitably. I\u2019m not making a full case for any particular model for UBI here, and I don\u2019t have to. My initial comment was to suggest there are many ways of doing UBI that don\u2019t necessitate leaving people behind. \n\nNo one is suggesting what you\u2019re saying. No one is talking about privatization of health care. Im certainly not saying UBI is an appropriate replacement for all social programs. Rather, a UBI may alleviate the costs associated with those programs, especially healthcare since people with a basic level of income tend to be, unsurprisingly, healthier than those living in poverty. I say it may, because we don\u2019t know, because we cancel it every time a conservative comes into office, but it seems to make sense in principle if we use our brains.\n\nI don\u2019t really care what the model is, as long as it improves outcomes for people at an acceptable, or lower cost. Presumably you want a system that allows people leeway to explore opportunities, be able to lose their jobs without worrying about whether they are going to starve (both are especially important in the context of increasing automation), and that reduces or maintains the overall cost of social programs while delivering the same or better benefits. Any other thing you can come up with, like for some reason a UBI necessitating the privatization of our healthcare system, does not have my endorsement.",

And if you fund it with, say, an increased sales tax and cutting other benefits (Yang's plan), you'd be a) gutting the administration of benefits people already depend on that might provide more fiscal value than the proposed UBI, and b) raising the cost of living for everybody at a flat rate, something which will hurt the poorest most because each extra cent means more when you don't have much of them to begin with (which pairs pretty brutally with problem a; if your benefits were already barely keeping you afloat, now suddenly everything costs more and your benefits are getting the axe, and opting into the UBI might still net you less financial support). And that meagre income bump, even for people not living on a knife's edge fiscally, while not enough to protect you against emergencies or bring you wholesale out of poverty, could give landlords and other leeches an excuse to just raise everybody's rent.\n\nShannon Ikebe gave a good accounting of this a few years back for Jacobin: https:\/\/www.jacobinmag.com\/2016\/01\/universal-basic-income-switzerland-finland-milton-friedman-kathi-weeks\/\n\nMain message: Can somebody please give me a concise explanation to why UBI is bad?

I'm not saying that the status quo is good, not at all, the banking system should be done away with, bankers prosecuted and so on, but what I am saying is that the monetary system should be democtarized. I see an ideal solution to this as a digital currency with a distributed voting system that can't become decentralized by miners or those staking, let alone by those those in power. But I do believe that there should be educated, committed experts (like a meritocracy) that IS democratically selected to propose changes and developments into the system, with of course anyone being able to present their ideas to the 'policy makers'. I guess like a meritocratic, democratized de- or semi-centralized, autonomous government treasury.\n\nThe private sector, unregulated, begets monopolies, to which the normal people do not have a say; the decisions are non-transparent, done behind closed doors, undemoctarically and pretty much only to benefit those who have power. That system, again, unregulated, ends up worse than a democratically elected government, with private armies etc.\n\nSo yeah, monetary policies and systems should be regulated to an extent, so that the private bankers and lobbers (who have created the fucked up system of today) wouldn't be able to grab all the power and all the money and basically enslave the rest of us.\n\nMy argument is this: private banks are already too powerful and leeching off of normal people's labour and turning everyone into a debt-slave in order to accumulate wealth and power (this is why our monetary policies are fucked, it's a vicious cycle), that system should be radically renewed (see what Iceland did in 2008-2010), private banks WITH private money would be a nightmare, like a corporate version of China+North Korea combined. Accumulation of money and power without a democratic and transparent decision making apparatus didn't exactly play out that beautifully in the USSR neither. Just imagine a corporate version of that, to the power of 100.\n\nWe need a better, democratized, transparent, fairly regulated free-market system with a digital currency that has the aformentioned properties baked into it. Truly by the people, for the people. Sadly, I don't know how that would be accomplished without a watchdog like the state or some other, trustworthy, transparent and democratic agent that we can throw out if we don't like them. Do tell if you have any suggestions.\n\nPS: we do have governments controlling the prices of the things you mentioned. Subsidies. Taxes. Budgets. Policies on monopolies and cartels. OPEC. G7, G20, ASEM and so on and so on..\n\nBut yeah. Crypto is a good side hustle as I mentioned. I love the de-fi movement for example and I can see that it could make way beautifully to universal basic income in the future.\n\nMain message: Is food too important to be disconnected from the state?  Or housing?  Or energy?\n\nI am failing to see the argument here.  As a centralized entity, a central bank places unnecessary amounts of power in the hands of the few.  The private sector, by contrast, spreads decision-making power across the entire market.  Prices act as indicators of how much to buy or sell.  The \"price\" of money (interest rates) is no different.  We don't have government controlling the prices of the things I mentioned above, so why should it control the prices of money?\n\nI would be perfectly ok with libra and unregulated banks existing, because they would not be the only things to exist.  We would have choices in an unregulated money market.  If libra didn't suit me, I could use something else instead (XMR obviously :p).  Under the current system up until now, there has been no other choice besides what the state has forced upon us.",

I'm talking about things like CHAZ (beyond a 'protest'... the demands are patently ridiculous). Setting buildings on fire with people inside them. Looting (not necessarily anything to do with the protests... I imagine many of the people I described simply used them as a cover).  Focusing on the 24\/7 news cycle.

But in no way are most people starting these or even a good percentage. Even if a few percent more are starting enterprising businesses, that does not mean it's a large percent of society as a whole. A few percent more businesses in America (and England too) could mean millions of new business. That still doesn't mean everyone has productive pursuits. Or even that most people do.\n\nMain message: You're making a false equivalency. The current global pandemic is not a fair comparison for what people will do if given economic freedom to pursue their interests via ubi and it's disingenuous to suggest otherwise.  \n  \nThere is record unemployment, a massive down shift in economic activity, and on top of that large social movements causing chaos. \n\nThe stimulus check that you describe as free money is hardly enough to pay people's rent let alone food and bills. It was also a one time payment which does not provide financial security when millions are losing their jobs and the economic forecasts look terrible. It's apples and oranges to compare this to ubi.\n\nAlso, what 'destructive pursuits' in particular are you talking about? The BLM protests? If so that's also not an argument against ubi, it's an argument against the state murdering citizens and denying them opportunities for centuries by pursuing policies designed to prevent economic and social freedom of movement.  \n  \nIn the UK people have been given 80% of their paychecks if they are furloughed so they can afford to stay at home.

I would disagree with you that the flat 12k\/yr would not help people losing 50k+ jobs to automation. You can scrape by on 12k\/yr, though it will be rough. \nHell, your year\u2019s UBI can buy [a building*](https:\/\/www.zillow.com\/homedetails\/2903-Montgomery-St-Detroit-MI-48206\/2083964107_zpid\/) .\n\n$12k a year is not \u201ca lot\u201d, but it is a non-trivial sum of money and I believe it is a hell of a lot better than the nothing you get when you\u2019ve lost your job.\n\nMain message: I'll be honest about Yang, I think he's a snake oil salesman. \n\nSo you're right that UBI is decent idea. But the way it is implemented in Yang's proposal is bad. For one, it's advertised as a way to make up for jobs lost to automation. But why does Yang consider automation an inevitability? Why does he consider people losing their jobs and livelihoods and entire neighborhoods collapsing just something we have to accept and live with?\n\nClearly the real problem here isn't the automation, but the fact that it is being used by capitalists to basically make more money for themselves at any cost to the communities it will destroy. It is just like the trade deals that shipped jobs overseas. Capitalist exploitation is seen as natural, inevitable, totally justifiable and not to be looked at in moral terms.\n\nWe need to understand that we can change how we look at automation and the market. It's not necessarily out of our control. We can make it so that the workers and the communities, not capitalists, decide how automation is implemented. And we can make it so that we the workers and communities benefit from automation (work less, make more) instead of just capitalists.\n\nThe other reason the UBI is bad is because, again, it's falsely advertised as giving us ownership of the economy, but it doesn't do that. It gives us a tiny, flat dividend that doesn't actually give us any control or actual ownership of our work. We could have a UBI or a wealth fund tied to the stock market, the way Norway does, and that would give us a lot more in return than just $12k a year, depending on how much ownership we have. And it would actually curb the power of the elite class by limiting their financial power and giving us direct control over the economy.\n\nAnd because it's just a small flat fee we're getting, it doesn't actually help people like it claims. What is a truck driver, making a decent wage, going to do with $12k a year? Especially when the small stores that might have hired him also shut down in small towns because the economy was based on serving truck drivers? If Yang's prediction is true, we are looking at mass upheaval and people will need more than just a small pay-off to survive. We need the public sector to step in, like it did during the depression, to get us out of this rut. We can't keep relying on \"entrepreneurship.\"\n\nAlso, you're right that there is an inequality of opportunity (and of all different sorts) in America. But that is *because* of capitalism. Capitalism was bourn out of a concentration of resources and wealth within a small class of people (what Marx called \"primitive accumulation\"). And this continues to happen all the time. Like when a recession hits, wealth is transferred from the bottom to the top, perpetuating the underclass that provides cheap labor to the capitalists. Capitalism relies on this inequality and we can never get rid of it until we move away from capitalism.",

They aren't typically creating solutions as much as patting themselves on the back most of the time. IMO, there is more *thought* about how socially acceptable and progressive  Durhamites are than are actually actively engaged in the Civil  process of doing something. \n\n\nSome examples: [rant] Schools suck... So what is being done to fix it? We're not trying to build new schools or pay teachers more or even create incentives for teachers to buy homes in their school districts where they can be invested in Durham itself. Crime is an issue so are we trying to pay police MORE to encourage more recruits for the almost 70 open police positions (starting salary comes out to just about $16\/hour so we're speaking FACTUALLY)? Does it bother anyone that we are replacing a Police Chief for the second time in 5 years? Nope we agree to spend more money on a bloated social program of 20 people who will be paid MORE than cops because this makes us socially \"aware\". We're doing this while being critical of the city council for removing the \"Defund the Police\" sign painted on the street outside of the police station after a Year! Many don't seem to see the correlation between this negative message and the rapidly expanding open position list at both 911 and in the police ranks (in case you didn't know, 911 is NOT a part of the police department). Also don't see any group pushing people to join AND CHANGE the department from within. Nope just lots of f*ck the police because that's the popular message to spread. People complain about housing prices but don't want to address the large number of houses that are rental properties (more than 50% which means there are not enough apartments yet) or that there are a significant number of unoccupied properties housing no one at all. Durhamites want to complain about building when there are giant SWATHS of underutilized land all over the city - the mostly empty dedicated Farmers Market space comes to mind not to mention the amount of flat parking lots. Food deserts have lost people's interest but we haven't solved the problem and have actually blocked multiple grocery options over the last decade. Everyone wants to talk about the Hayti like it was the only neighborhood devastated by the interstate when it happened more than 50 years ago - its a singular, acceptable position without being cognizant that there were significantly impacted pockets all over the city, not just this one. People complain about the homeless but aren't willing to donate to charities or programs (or taxes) that would help get and keep people off the street.[ \/rant]",

So someone has to be happy with the ceo's performance.\n\nThe lowest workers contribute the least amount as an individual, thus why their individual wages are shitty.  The disconnect isn't at the C level, it's at the lowest level when they assume they are worth more than they are.  They are substantially easier to replace than people further up the chain and that is part of the equation to determining their wage.  And yet again, why I think a UBI with annual inflation indexing along with elimination of minimum wage is the answer.\n\nHere's a funny vid that touches on some of it albeit some of it is just bs.\nhttps:\/\/reason.com\/video\/mostly-weekly-minimum-wage\/\nAndrew Heaton imo has good delivery although some of his points I don't think are completely spot on.\n\nMain message: Why do you guys always assume when we advocate for communism or socialism that we are afraid of working?\n\nIf anything communism requires more work from us than capitalism would.\n\nEither way. The situation I\u2019m in is solid. I\u2019m not housing insecure. I\u2019m not food insecure. That is of my own making. I\u2019m not rich, but I\u2019m not poor and I\u2019ve worked to get to where I am.

If every non-corporate worker quit McDonalds today, they would be bankrupt in a week.\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate balance. The problem is that this has an upward concentrating effect. The lowest workers get paid so little and get little recognition, when they run the company. The corporate workers get the most money and the most recognition, when they help organize the workers.\n\nThe problem is there\u2019s a disconnect between the C level and low level employees, one is beholden to the other for their life. This leads to a lot of exploitation, and that\u2019s something that we need to fix.",

It might be hard for arrogant, educated people to understand, but it's actually very uncommon for working-class people to speak a foreign language well enough to feel comfortable moving to continental Europe, whereas English is world's lingua franca. This is just one of many nuances of so-called \"freedom of movement\" which you may want to consider because telling an entire country they just need to \"fucking improve themselves\".\n\nYeah the British education system fucking sucks, I mean we spend what only 5 years of high school forcing a second language which is far far far too late for language education to actually matter. But I'm pretty sure the government knows this so what can we say. Government forcing people to be morons by knowingly fucking us education wise is probably reason we have so many minimum wage workers who are in for a shock when we finally do eliminate most minimum wage jobs.",

(Which isn't enough to live on, you'd need at least double that, but let's assume we've settled on $10,000 as the 'right' amount.)\n\n320 million people x $10,000 = 3.2 Trillion dollars.  For reference, the 2015 Federal budget was 3.8 Trillion. So UBI will almost double the Federal Budget.\n\nSpending twice as much means the government needs to collect twice as much in taxes.  But it makes no sense to tax the UBI as income, as you'd literally be handing people money and taking it right back. So, it'll be people who actually earn money above UBI who get their taxes increased - and *more* than doubled, to make up the difference.  \n\nThis will encourage people to not work- why bother working, if the government takes so much in taxes? (This is the same basic 'trap' as welfare-  Welfare gets taken away when you get a job, so you end up with a choice- do nothing on welfare and get $, or work and still get just $.)  So more people will live off UBI.\n\nThe other way to increases taxes is on companies.  This will place high threshold for people wanting to start a business, and will encourage big companies to leave the USA.  And the ones that stay will no doubt raise prices, both to cover the increased taxes, and because 'everyone has all they Free Money to spend'.\n\nIn the end, it is just not practical to pay everyone to do nothing.  TANSTASFL. *Some* people will need to pay for it, and they'll get tired of carrying the burden and either join the UBI'ers, or leave the country.\n\nMain message: What a stupid idea. Why stop at $500\/month? Why not $1000\/month or $5000? If they just want to say they are going to give people free money without providing any context as to who gets the money or how it is going to be paid for then what is the point of throwing out an arbitrary amount like $500. If giving people $500 of free money is a good idea then giving them $5000 is an even better idea right? ",

    "text":"Comment response: That is fair.\n\nI wonder though if innovation would fall or whether it would just shift away from what we view as the traditional\/acceptable areas that require innovation. Humans aren't going to stop being creative but right now innovation is somewhat synonymous with 'inventions\/adaptations which generate more profits for companies'. If people's creativity is becomes focussed elsewhere that would indeed be a profound shift for any economy. It is right to be concerned about that, I would hope any country seriously looking to implement UBI would ensure their economy is correctly incentivised to be remain competitive (at least until most countries have also implemented UBI).\n\nI'm also not complete convinced that all innovation is productive. Do we really need 50 types of laundry detergent? Perhaps we'd be better off and with a less resource intensive and more efficient economy if such unproductive innovation ended.\n\nMain message: My fear is that with an excessive level of guaranteed support for everyone that made them feel too comfortable, we'd have the double threat of huge operating costs and low incentive to innovate.  This would cause us to stagnate and become more vulnerable to internal disruption (like the political polarization we see now) and external threats.  We'd lose competitiveness on the global stage, which might eventually translate into loss of power or (worst case) sovereignty as we balkanize. I feel like we're already teetering on a knife edge, so we need to be careful.\n\nI don't *know* that there would be any huge down sides.  All I can say with certainty is that our modern first world society (in the US) is one of the most complex, stochastic systems I can think of.  It's impossible to predict the effects of massive social policy changes.\n\nPlease take my concerns with a grain of salt - I'm not a big fan of paternalism and feel that people should generally succeed or fail on their own merits, but have an opportunity to compete equally if they so choose.  At the same time, I don't want to push my world view on anyone else.  \n",

That wouldn't make sense to me. Working to reduce casualties when a shooting does occur is also important, not just preventing them.\n\nAnd sure a similar affect can be achieved without bump stocks, but it is more difficult to achieve and more barriers are good for preventing the more hot blooded crimes or mentally unstable individuals.\n\n We can add a military exemption, there's a lot of training in the military and individuals are taught a lot of discipline and responsibility so I don't really see a problem with that. You might say members of our military have experience similar to a well regulated militia.\n\nI agree with you on waiting periods for the first purchase only. I figure the waiting periods address instances of individuals going out to get a gun for the first time. Otherwise they'd already have a gun and the period wouldn't really matter. A rigorous training course in order to get a firearm license could be part of the waiting period.\n\nAdmittedly, I don't know everything there is to know about the gunshow loophole. But I don't like the idea of private individuals being able to sell guns to whoever without a criminal or mental background check, is it such a problem to require them? Seems like it would be an easy and simple enough service for the NRA or gunshops to act as an intermediary, they can help provide the check and the purchase between the individuals can go through legally. I think accountability in the system is important.\n\nWhat does UBI stand for? Unexplained beer injury?\n\nMain message: Parkland shooter used low cap magazines. Bump stocks are a novelty item, you can replicate them same action by putting your finger through your belt loop. I can't wait for the left to find out that things like binary and echo triggers exist, then bump stocks won't even be an issue to them. As far as age limits go, raise the military age to 21 and I'll agree. Waiting periods for first gun purchase only, none after that. Gun show loophole isn't a loophole it was written into the law as such in order to get the Brady bill passed. But UBIs can be implemented, i'm sure gun owners would be willing to compromise if suppressors are delisted as NFA items or something like that.",

As a taxed benefit it is more progressive in that lower income recipients pay a lower tax percentage than higher income recipients.

A 30% flat tax and 15k (untaxed) UBI ( http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/3bYTJ\/11\/ ) would create a net 0 tax obligation at $50k income, and negative tax rates below that income amount.

You do not have to be a citizen to live or be in the United States; but it definitely makes those things much more convenient.\n\nAs a licensed gun-owner, you get the perks of CHL; along with the certificate of being a responsible and involved firearms holder. Just as industries with drivers require CDL's to drive; perhaps industries with guns would foster licensed individuals for specific qualifying positions, which would make candidates more likely to be hired for those type jobs due to better credentials.\n\nIf an officer decides to pull someone over and runs their plates and sees they are licensed owner... the \"He's got a gun!\" type police incidents which often result in casualties would likely subside. This is already provable as holding a CHL often immediately changes how an officer perceives you(typically in a better light than if not, even if you aren't\/weren't carrying a gun). It typically humanizes them into relating to that individual, rather than persisting their engrained \"Us vs. Them\"  mentality.\n\nIn countries with Firearms educations and provisions(where everyone is allowed to have a gun pubicaly even),  the rates of gun violence are significantly lower than in the US.\n\nEven if you enforce licensing for sales, people on the black market will still sell and acquire them; people who have always had them will continue to do so, if Yang is being realistic, this will not be a requirement, but an opt-in with perks.\n\nMain message: Hopefully Andrew sees this, because one sentence could lose him the election.",

It's not really moving wealth for one group to another, it's giving everyone over 18 a baseline wealth to begin with. Not redistribution so much as it is changing the rules of capitalism so that instead of some people starting with lots of capital and others starting with none, everyone starts with a baseline level of capital. Capitalism works best when everyone is participating in it, so I think UBI great boom for our economy if implemented.\n\nAlso it is interesting to me you mention that wealth redistribution is a Democratic strategy.

The Democrats want to give more money and benefits to the lower classes in society with a verity of social programs, while the Republicans want to cut taxes (more heavily on the wealthy and businesses) while also spending tons of tax payer money on unnecessary military buildup and corporate welfare.

If all we need is universal basic income, but we can hang onto things like private property and free markets, then that would be great, since those things have proven to be efficient at providing good incentives and allocating resources, and complementary to political freedom. But I haven't given it a whole lot of thought and I'm open to any new idea that makes sense. Pure socialism I am pretty set against due to all the things laid out in Milton Friedman's book.\n\nI know you're looking for commonalities, but the major difference between myself and a marxist like Dr. Wolff is that I think our current system is overall pretty fair, and I believe it could last indefinitely if it wasn't for artificial intelligence. Yes, a lot of tweaks are needed, but I think the basic structure is sound. In my ideal world every country would have open borders and we could try out all kinds of different systems on a limited scale using seasteading or special legal zones within existing countries. Heck, maybe some form of communism could work at the right scale and with the right set of tweaks, with people who participate voluntarily.\n\nI strongly disagree with his statement that stockholders just sit around and collect money that is basically stolen from workers. Creating and maintaining a company is real labor, and though stockholders typically pay someone else to do that labor, that money comes from somewhere, usually money that those people have earned (or their parents\/grandparents earned) by benefiting other people in one way or another. One thing we might have in common is that I believe the value of unimproved real estate should be taxed at 100%, since that really is something that people profit off of simply because they own it, since it would exist with or without the owner. Milton Friedman was known to call it \"the least bad tax\".\n\nIf we are looking for things in common probably the best place is our common enemies. I absolutely will be voting for Bernie if he ends up being the candidate, as I would much rather have a European-style democratic welfare state than the fascist Christian white nationalist dictatorship we are headed for. I'd rather have crappy national health insurance than the over-regulated basically non-existent (for a lot of people) private health insurance we have right now. I mean, the kind of pure right-libertarianism I'm all about is incredibly unpopular anyway, much more so than socialism, so I'd rather have the next best thing that is politically viable and at least allows people to live decent lives.\n\nMain message: &gt;I do think that at a certain point artificial intelligence and technology in general will become so advanced that the majority of people will be outclassed by automation, and at that point capitalism may need serious adjustments (universal basic income) or need to be replaced completely, but I don't think we are nearly there yet.\n\nHonestly, this is where I hope most people stand. The biggest misconception people have about Marxism is that Marxism mean capitalism = bad. Capitalism is a natural progression societies have to go through, and it\u2019s very efficient! Marxism just recognizes that capitalism is, like feudalism and slavery, a flawed, temporary stage of society. The internal conflict between paying workers who buy your products as little as possible is just an example of how capitalism is unstable. As long as we can agree capitalism won\u2019t last forever, I can respect your opinion. You\u2019re way better than the psychos who think we\u2019ll be capitalist until the end of time (can you imagine how horrible that would be?)\n\nYou know, you can even make the argument that libertarians *are* marxists, especially if they recognize the impermanence of capitalism. We *need* poorer countries to develop to have a successful, worldwide revolution. Countries like Somalia are essentially stuck in feudalism, and trying to spread capitalism there is, on some levels, ethical and good. Spreading capitalism to places who have never had it is overall better for society. \n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s not even entirely wrong that our labor is being outsourced to China. They need to develop as well. Evidence seems to support that China is doing a decent job developing. That\u2019s why a lot of modern Marxist work is just trying to lay the groundwork for future economic systems, rather than a complete, radical revolution. Testing the waters with worker owned businesses and the like is helping us prepare for the time that capitalism can\u2019t support us. \n\nAt this point, it seems us Marxists believe that capitalism should be ended \u201cprematurely\u201d before it gets completely dystopian, and, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you seem to want to wait until we\u2019re sure it\u2019s unfixable before we shift? \n\nI think you and I (and by extension, classical marxists and libertarians\/capitalists) agree on a lot more than we think. I might disagree on specifics, maybe even a lot of specifics, but I\u2019m trying to bridge a couple gaps here. The world could use more understanding.",

This is because, as someone much smarter than me said, a poor American does not identify as poor but as a temporarily embarrassed millionaire. This shame towards being economically exploited is what causes them to lash out against those of different race, religion etc.. Ultimately I think it will be the \"establishment\" that will bail everyone out (e.g. UBI) once automation takes over, simply because of the fact that the wealthy can't stay wealthy in a consumerist culture unless the masses can consume, and for that they need an income. \n\nMain message: As an American, I feel I can safely say that neither the Democrat nor Republican party is going to help in this issue. They are the establishment, and the establishment has a hegemony on the entire US political sphere.\n\nIn terms of the Occupy Movement (and look up the Tea Party movement while you're at it), I believe those fractured and fell apart *because the American public doesnt have a concrete, universal, and collective understanding of what our probems are*. These movements popped up with the economic crisis of 2008-20??, but without a single defining narrative fell apart via fragmentation.\n\nAmerican's dont want war with anyone. We dont want our imperialist foreign policy, we dont want our corporations running roughshod over our lives (and the lives of other country's people), we dont want to be jobless nor do we want other nation's people to be jobless.\n\nAmerica's greatest curse right now is that it's viciously divided. It blames race, it blames religion, it blames terrorism, it blames immigration, it blames outsourcing, it blames sex... the dominant narrative wants to find the answer to its problems (and the problem it exports to peoples of other nations), but no one can agree on the answer since all the proposed answers are merely symptoms. \n\nThe real answer (in *my* opinion) is to realize the battle is one of class and not of things like sex, race, religion, immigration, etc; when America's people finally realizes their strength in unity (and thus the strength of numbers), this country will blow the fucking world away by its response.\n\nAmerica has sleeping within a spirit of resistance, and once its uncaged no tyrant will stand a chance in hell.

To unfairly condense his argument: capitalism has been inventing bullshit work for us to do to maintain its political power because capitalism has always been, at its core, about political power, not economic efficiency. Therefore, we COULD be working far fewer hours, but that would take us recognising that today's economy isn't some natural, apolitical institution, and making institutional changes. And his closing chapter discusses UBI as a possible solution to the reasons\/problems he sees.\n\nHis book has been getting a lot of attention recently because with coronavirus-related self-isolation all around the world, people are finally having to admit \"actually I don't need to work in an office, 9 to 5, for 5 days a week to get all of my assigned work done. Maybe this crazy guy was right.\"\n\nEdit: he more explicitly tackles your question in Utopia of Rules, which is just three long form essays of his. One of them starts with your question: why hasn't productive technology delivered all the fantastic utopian imaginings that people in the 60s thought it would? Why in the richest time in all human history do we seem to be even further from a post-scarcity utopia than back in the 60s? The essay is purposefully provocative and less rigorous as a result, but it raises an interesting question (among others): is new science and technology discovered through a natural process of pushing the boundaries....or do the structures of power decide WHICH technologies we even BOTHER to research.

We've done UBI in Alaska for 40 years so it isn't unprecedented here in the States.  Elsewhere from Finland to Namibia UBI has been tested and it always proves to be a good idea and that inspires me to push it at a national level in the hopes of making it global.  So, you're completely right and of course a World View is the ultimate right answer.\n\nI would like to gather more information on some things to expand my folio of argument-defeaters.  Some of this is probably easy to find but I've not gotten around to it, other stuff I just don't know where to look.\n\nHow much money per year does the US pay out for social programs?  What is the bureaucratic cost of these programs per year?  How much more tax money would we need to get every American 18+ to $2,000.00 per month under the following design:\n\nThe UBI is progressively taxed back, beginning when wages earned reach $4K\/m and are completely taxed away by $~100,000 with continued progressive taxation up the income ladder.  In short, while accumulating a pay-raise of $52K you're gradually letting go of $24K of entitlement.\n\nThe Capital Gains rate is tied to the maximum tax rate for labor.  Labor should never subsidize capital.\n\nR\n\nMain message: Hey Rick, \nI understand you are running for office, so America first and all that, but we do ourselves and the world a disservice by disregarding a [global structure of economic enfranchisement](https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/User:Tralfamadoran777) in favor of a welfare distribution scheme for our country alone.\n\nParticularly when the cost would be the same, or less\n\nThe benefits would be so much greater, because if we truly are the greatest nation, we should continue to lead even after distributing the power to create money to each adult human on the planet\n\nThis power that we miserly hold can simply be distributed to each by allowing each to claim a Share of the fiat credit that backs our currencies, for deposit in trust with their local bank, as part of an actual social contract...\n\n...along with requiring sovereign debt to be backed with the value of these Shares, then each will receive an equal share of the interest paid on global sovereign debt, as a BI\n\nIf you hold your jaw just right, and squint, you should be able to see that this is the return mechanism that is missing, to provide the trickle down, as compensation for voluntarily restricting our freedom to respect the rights of others, for cooperating with society and respecting the local laws and customs, and for placing our Shares of the economy in trust with our community banks, to be invested for our benefit\n\nMany will demonstrate how this great nation or that may easily provide $1,000\/month to each adult citizen as a welfare distribution, collected from the rich\n\nThen though, the global problems remain, or more likely get worse, because there simply does not exist in the world enough money\/capital,to provide 7 billion people with $1,000\/month in a sustainable manner\n\nSince the foundation of the global economy, any economy, and society, is debt... our debt to society, and society's debt to us... without cost, we can distribute the right to loan $1,000 USD equivalent into existence to each, and create the potential for sufficient capital to be created and provide each with an equal Share of the foundation of our economy\n\nThen let the repaired market take care of it\n\nThanks so much for your kind indulgence\n\nLet's not half ass this thing now, it's important\n*oh yeah, so for the same $1,000\/month\/person we would pay for BI, we also get $1,000,000\/ person of sustainably priced credit deposited into our banks, and an actual level playing field",

Social Democrats are fairly common though.\n\n\n&gt; Both of these emphasise bottom-up control, putting it in opposition to both Marxism-Leninism\n\n\n\nThe idea of bottom-up control and decentralising control of the factors of production is all well and good theoretically. My issue, however, is that it's not practical in real life. All this does is create a power vacuum, which some entity will rise to fill and reshape the arrangement to further cement its own power and support groups. Like Animal Farm illustrated, \"All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others.\"\n\n\n\nMy main issue with Socialism is that it's human nature to compete and attempt to get ahead, and Socialism represses that urge, which is a major disincentive for innovations and encourages satisfice and stagnation. Socialists tend to be more concerned with the difference in relative incomes, rather than increasing incomes across the board. Thatcher once illustrated my point in [a PMQ.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/okHGCz6xxiw?t=114) Imo, it's a far better long-term solution to focus on equal opportunities for all. Capitalism with guaranteed individual rights is a far more stable, longer term arrangement. It all comes down to incentives and human nature. Though ultimately I feel some sort of UBI system will rise in response to increasing mechanisation and automation.\n\n\nMain message: Yes. \n\nI think there's two major misunderstandings from non-leftists about socialism. \n\nThe first is that socialism=Marxism-Leninism, or at least socialism is a system which emphasises state authority. If you speak to leftists, you'll find the major trends are that more moderate socialists (like Corbyn) support a more mixed economy, where key infrastructure is run as a state owned co-operate (or operated in a democratic fashion by the workers, not top-down), and there is greater regulation on the market economy. More radical socialists support a system which emphasises democratic control of all workplaces. Both of these emphasise bottom-up control, putting it in opposition to both Marxism-Leninism and Western capitalism.\n\nThe second is that state authority and capitalism are antithetical. The argument goes that the USSR wasn't capitalist because things were run by the state. I think this shows a misunderstanding about what capitalism is, at least defined in a Marxist sense. Capitalism is not about vague platitudes like 'freedom' and 'liberty', capitalism is a specific structuring of the workplace and the economy, one where you have the owners (i.e. the bourgeoisie) who control the means of production, and the workers (i.e. the proletariat) who work on the means of production but don't get a democratic say in how they are run. In the USSR, the business owners you'd find in the West were replaced by state bureaucrats. But the structures within the workplace remained the same. And that's why people label those systems as 'state capitalist'.  \n\nSo if you look at Venezuela, certain industries may have been nationalised, but they were still ran in a capitalistic fashion, with state bureaucrats taking over from the CEOs.",

It isn't perfect and you can find small issues but the reason our society works is because prices reflect supply and demand.\n\n&gt;Price mechanisms are important in the context of scarcity. We don't have that any more - we have abundance. We are so productive we literally can't find shit for people to do any more. Prices are obsolete.\n\nWe still have scarcity. It is ridiculous to think we have moved past it. Think about anything you cannot afford and then think about how scarce that thing is. Then think about something you can afford and think about how scarce that thing is. If we redistributed more wealth through basic income and heavy income taxes then you would be able to afford a lot more but there would still be things that are too scarce for you to afford.\n\n&gt;The problem is, prices can be manipulated, and are\n\nThen fix that problem. Do not scrap the whole system. You mentioned basic income which is a great way to redistribute wealth in a capitalistic society . We can also get rid of money in politics and stop corporate influence over how they are governed. We can also stop monopolies from controlling markets and fixing prices directly.\n\nThere are many issues with modern day capitalism but the solution is not to scrap it and start over. We rely on it for almost every aspect of our lives. The solution is to evolve and control it to our benefit. \n\nMain message: Your question presumes that prices accurately reflect human need, which they certainly don't. The best defense you can mount is that the price mechanism is the closest we can come to an actual accounting.\n\nThe problem is, prices can be manipulated, and are, and there are many factors that are impossible to capture in a price, and, finally, and lastly, while prices may be accurate in many ways, where the money ends up has nothing to do with any of this stuff.\n\nFor example, land. We can all agree that land is valuable; we can set a price for it. What doesn't make any *sense* is that some particular person receives this price. Why? That guy did not create the land or make it valuable; they were arbitrarily assigned the right to it. This is how the vast majority of human wealth is apportioned (I mean this literally - most of our wealth is in real estate), and the mechanism makes no sense.\n\nIn any case, I'd say a better alternative is to not try. A great deficiency in our current system is needs that go unmet because people lack capital. If someone cannot pay for a good, they will not receive it. This, despite the obvious widespread underutilization of productivity - so much of the world is unemployed, and simultaneously so much of the world has needs unmet. A strange paradox...\n\nLet's have a system that directly answers human need instead of answering human need contingent on prices being met. Price mechanisms are important in the context of scarcity. We don't have that any more - we have abundance. We are so productive we literally can't find shit for people to do any more. Prices are obsolete.\n\nHow this is implemented is up to you. Just giving shit away is a good one - basic income guarantees, for example, ensure that people can meet their needs no matter what, and eventually make prices seem nonsensical. How we produce goods can also change - right now there is no connection between my productivity and my consumption (what I do all day to make money has no relation to the things I buy). This is very different from the way humanity historically operated, under subsistence.\n\nAnyway, I could go on even longer, but another time.",

But then you get everything as a lump sum once per year, which means you have to budget like hell to survive until your next payment. You get the money for being poor 18 to 20 months after you've started being poor, in the worst case, or six months in the best case. This isn't a good arrangement.\n\nThe next simplest is to pay it throughout the year. As part of filing taxes this year, and also when you start or leave a job, you estimate how much you'll be making and enroll in that much advance NIT. During tax season, you calculate the difference and pay or get a rebate. If you get a rebate, you can take it as part of your weekly payment over the next year, or as a lump sum.\n\nIf you get inconsistent pay from one week to the next, it might be difficult to predict how much NIT you will get and thus how much money you will get. With UBI, it might be difficult to predict the size of your paycheque.\n\nHowever you slice it, you're pushing complexity onto recipients.\n\nUBI, by contrast, keeps complexity where it already is: payroll and small businesses. It's not *great* that small business owners have to explicitly set aside money for taxes and keep that in mind when budgeting. But on the other hand, small business owners in my country have to file taxes quarterly, so they don't have quite as much room to get into a bad situation.\n\nWith a UBI, you cycle a lot more income through your government. This might introduce delays. It also produces a much larger sticker price.\n\nMain message: What's better NIT or UBI",

There are economic pundits with neoliberal leanings venturing into the fray.  These are not the only UBI advocates.  They are the UBI advocates many of the people here would be surprised to know about.  A little bit of digging will get them there.\n3.   \"But if you have even a small economic knowledge, it should be apparent\" ... has no bearing on anything you're saying.  That's not name calling, it's quantifying the level of economic knowledge needed to understand the scope of the changes that will be wrought by a UBI.  \n\nYou're looking for someone to bash, and have purposely misread my comments.  Go get your jollies somewhere else.\n\nMain message: You dismissed UBI advocates with \"people you wouldn't listen to touting UBI\", \"don't just wave a flag for an idea you don't understand\", \" But if you have even a small economic knowledge, it should be apparent\". Characterising that as calling people who argue\nfor UBI idiots is not unreasonable.\n\nIf you truly wish to make a case, present your arguments, don't\nresort to name calling one side and lauding the other.\n",

I believe that would be the time where every person interested can be involved in research of their own interests, that in the combination of universal basic income. But the key is to prepare for it now by providing quality education NOW!\n\nMain message: Yup. I am no expert, but I think that we should figure out what society should do with unskilled people like craftsmen. Automation may not be able to replace all jobs immediately, but it will keep encroaching on unskilled trades. \n\n\nNot saying these are the only solutions: just what I've come up with off the top of my head. And they aren't mutually exclusive, either.\n\n\n1) Solution 1: be compassionate, offer education at a reduced cost (or even for free). This will help those who want to learn find jobs which require more education.\n\n2) Solution 2: implement population-control measures. The goal of this is to try to ensure that there isn't so large a population that a significant number\/percentage of them are in the lower classes. This can be done humanely, by increasing education levels. \n\nThis shows that the Indian ~~population~~ fertility rate has been decreasing since 1960 - http:\/\/data.worldbank.org\/indicator\/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?view=map&amp;year_high_desc=true. \n\nAdditionally, the literacy rate has increased since then, to 74% in 2011 - http:\/\/censusindia.gov.in\/2011-prov-results\/data_files\/india\/Final_PPT_2011_chapter6.pdf.\n\nCorrelation is not causation, but it may be suggestive.\n\nEDIT: Originally wrote \"population\" instead of \"fertility rate\".

So then you'd receive $46k for 3 days work each week.\n\nCompare that to the existing example, where 3 days a week pro-rata would be $36k a year.\n\nMain message: I don't understand how a UBI can be anything BUT inflationary...\n\nFor the sake of round numbers, let's say a UBI is $1000 a week, and I currently earn $60k\/year (roughly average). Does that mean I now earn $110k? Because that's hugely inflationary. \n\nOr, if I earn over the UBI rate, do I pay it all back in tax, effectively working full time for an entire year for $10k?\n\nIn which case, why would I do that?",

May I remind you, for the 12th time, that it is paid for by the VAT, from corporations who literally pay zero in taxes.\n\nAlso, yes hospitals will make slightly less money, but they will also need less. I find it ludicrous that you think, that hospitals have a select amount of costs regardless of the patients, which is where your argument fails.\n\nAnd I disagree with you saying, that you can't get the money from the rich. If you would be talking about a wealth tax I would agree, since the rich would simply not live in the USA any more. A VAT, however, works because the US has a huge market and corporations can't really avoid it. Avoiding a .1% tax like this would only make them worse off.\n\nAnd you're wrong about the VAT not being enough.\nProof is on yang2020.com\n\nIt's not rocket science.\n\nMain message: [deleted]",

    "text":"Comment response: I'll have to digest some of the stuff you just said to see if I understand, but if UBI and UH costs 37.5% of the economy (which we are a part of so it isn't just all cost) then that means that every American will have all the basic necessities for 37.5% of the economic out then it really starts to look attractive.   I don't think this would include housing though so that is one last large cost.  I mean the tax foundation put the current effective tax rate for an average american to 31% (I swear I saw this a month ago because I was comparing Canada but I can't find it now).  So if it went up 7% but we got all that I think that would be pretty amazing.\n\nMain message: But to really have UBI, one would also require Universal Healthcare, as there really isn't any way to tie it to an employer after that.\n\nA low ball estimate of UH is 25-33 Trillion over 10 years (Note that that is with cuts of payments to doctors, hospitals, clinics, nurses, pharmacists, drugs, equipment, ect... i.e. reducing it down to the pay of what other countries do).  So we will go with the higher end of that, meaning another 3T a year or now 32% of the economic output of the US.  (So pretty much a minimum of 32% tax rate on everything at this time)\n\nThen, adding in the cost of the normal government running, and not reducing the military spending at this time just to keep things calculated, we will estimate about 60% of the budget (old) is removed due to those two programs, so there is still about 1.5 Trillion more to that.  That means we are effectively requiring 7.5 T of our entire economic output (not government revenue, but full output of the entire economy).  Let's round the economy up to 20T to make it easier to calculate.  That means we need to have ALL taxes at a Fed level (ignore all state\/local\/school ect taxes) of 37.5% of the economy, no tax breaks, no reductions for hardships, that is everyone (or we can use progressive but that is impossible to calculate so we will leave it like this.).  It starts looking a bit more painful when looking at all the changes needed added to it to make UBI actually work in the US. \n\n\nI am not saying UBI is terrible or not, I am just trying to look at the full picture of the costs and not just a rose colored glasses look.\n\nHere is the basic source I used to pull spending from\n\nhttps:\/\/media.nationalpriorities.org\/uploads\/total_spending_pie%2C__2015_enacted.png",

    "text":"Comment response: I'd be much more in favor of a universal basic income than Welfare, Social Security, etc.  Part of the reason I've favored FairTax where prebates cover UBI. Additionally, it doesn't disincentivize working as welfare does (the Welfare Cliff).  But if you're going to have a UBI, then eliminate the minimum wage.  You can't make an argument for a \"livable\" wage if that's covered with a UBI.\n\nThe other reason I've swung to being in favor the UBI is that automation and AI are going to eliminate jobs altogether.  This isn't a case of buggy whip manufacturers going out of business and jobs going to manufacturing.  Transportation is a perfect example.   Once long-haul trucking is automated, millions of jobs dependent upon that industry are gone.  That will just be the start.  \n\nThe problem would be cost.  Say the UBI replaces Welfare, food stamps, Social Security, etc.  Each US citizen 18+ receives $25k.  That's $6 trillion dollars a year.  Say 1\/3 comes back as taxes making it $4 trillion dollars a year (or you pay it out as non-taxable income).  That's still $4 trillion dollars a year.   That's more than the   tax revenues for 2017.  That's not really workable.\n\nSo you shrink the numbers.  There are 67 million people on government assistance in the US.  I'm going to say half of that number is adults.  You have 61 million people collection Social Security.  Just to make the numbers rounded, let's say 100 million people would receive UBI.  That's $1.6 trillion (if you calculate they receive the money tax free).  That's a more workable number.\n\nThere would have to be some MAJOR overhauls of everything the government does for this to work.  Given that we're saddled with a 2-party system that absolutely sucks...I can't see any movement to a UBI in my lifetime.\n\nMain message: Finnish citizens given universal basic income report lower stress levels and greater incentive to work",

    "text":"Comment response: And all those successful and well off people aren't going to benefit from UBI are they? They are also the people most likely to enjoy doing what they are doing. Most people who don't enjoy what they do and only do it out of necessity do not keep doing it when they don't need to. \n\nThe majority of people work because they need to work to provide for themselves. Just because 'not everyone does' doesn't make the statement 'people work for their incomes' untrue. \n\nThere isn't anyone who 'through a drive to contribute and develop' will do those shitkicker jobs that need to be done. People aren't going to go clean toilets for the fun of it. \n\nAnd people dont work for personal fulfilment over the minimum of personal safety. They work to provide a certain degree of comfort for themselves and their family. No one is going 'oh my family would be able to scrap by if I only worked two days a week so I'm only doing the extra three because I love it'. People want to be able to afford nice houses, decadent meals, holidays, entertainment, pets etc. And usually to do so they have to work jobs where they can't just choose their own hours.\n\nMain message: It's because not everyone does. There's another thread on this sub asking why high wealth individuals continue to work even when they have enough money to retire, because it's a very common practice. I've known a lot of very successful and well off people who continue to work well into their retirement.\n\nLots of people work for a sense of purpose, meaning and to provide for their community. Hell lots of people volunteer for exactly the same reason.\n\nBut even that is beside the point. The concept of a UBI is to guarantee a minimum level of personal protection to ensure people make decisions about their work through a drive to contribute and develop rather than a necessity for survival. It's basically our current system but with a more robust absolute minimum guarantee. The drive to gain more comforts, extravagances, enjoyments, status, fulfilment, etc out of life won't change, it would just be more inclusive.\n\nIf you are currently working a job that affords you more than the absolute minimum in personal safety then you already know what it's like to work for personal fulfilment rather than income.",

Again, that sucks for the non-citizens, it's not that the landlords will change the rates for them, especially given that as the infographic says it's illegal.

And this deficit accumulates every year requiring additional funds to be added from external sources. One solution is how UBI functions in Saudi Arabia, being funded mostly from oil revenue. Without an easily exploitable resource tho, it becomes extremely complicated, if not impossible to finance the model.\n\nSo to achieve such a system would require massive changes both to how we govern ourselves on a global scale and to our perception of value. To get this going we would most likely need to have achieved nuclear fusion or some other form of 'unlimited' energy generation technology.",

    "text":"Comment response: Sounds like you might have a background in writing. Would you interested in writing a short story about how UBI changes the life of a struggling American? The subject could be someone like an ex-factory worker, homeless person, or someone that just got out of prison.\n\nMain message: So, a few problems here.\n\nFrom the third paragraph:\n\n&gt; The teenager responded with \u2018my bad\u2019, and the gang member calmed down and just grunted \u2018yo, watch out next time\u2019. \u2018My bad\u2019 was a phrase of respect that Markiese used frequently when he found himself in any similar escalated situation.\n\nYou introduce this concept as being important, but the payoff of it is lost when it's eventual use by the protagonist is a throwaway line that comes immediately after. There is no conflict for the protagonist, so it doesn't develop anything.\n\nIn the next paragraph:\n\n&gt; By the age of nine, Markiese\u2019s friends had already started hanging with gang members. It\u2019s unfortunate, but most of them grew up without a father figure and joining a gang provided the male influence that a lot them craved.\n\nThis does essentially the same thing. It introduces a potential point of conflict, but it doesn't really address it in anyway. The story should be instead exploring Markiese dealing with this experience and how it affects him. This only gets addressed in the second to last paragraph, but we don't see any real conflict in it. It just gets summed up and concluded in two lines:\n\n&gt;  Markiese could not help but be a little jealous of his half-sister, but he felt glad that she would likely not have the troubled childhood that was so common for many people from their neighborhood. It was incredibly difficult for Markiese to forgive his father for abandoning him but he could tell that Derrick\u2019s efforts to re-connect were genuine.\n\nNeither do all that much to provide that conflict, nor provide a good resolution to conflict.\n\n&gt; Before the age of 15, he had been robbed 7 times for items ranging from his winter coat to a ham and cheese sandwich. The food that Markiese\u2019s mother served came predominantly from the food bank or what she could afford from the corner market with her EBT card. For a couple years, Malcolm worked part time at a McDonald\u2019s. One night after work, Malcolm brought home 100 McNuggets. Before 2021, that was Makiese\u2019s favorite memory.\n\nHere you provide three different plot threads, one after the other, but don't explore any of them.\n\n&gt; Malcolm was right. Things did improve in the South Side.\n\nOnce you get here, you have passed a climax point because you are resolving problems with this line, but there really wasn't any kind of climax to begin with. You somewhat try to wrap up a few of the older plot threads that you brought up, but without any significant meaning or conflict in them. This is further exacerbated by introducing Markiese's father in the next paragraph, which attempts to introduce conflict by saying he abandoned them, but again doesn't explore that.\n\nThis brings us to the last bit:\n\n&gt; \u201cOnce you get UBI Kiese, you can move wherever you want, we\u2019re not gonna abandon the South Side now that things might start getting good\u201d, said Malcolm.\n\nThis sets up potential for another plot thread. It is given extremely brief exploration with the listing of cities to travel to, but without anything substantive beyond that. It just ends up getting concluded with:\n\n&gt; Who knows, Markiese may just end right back in the South Side after he realizes there is no place quite like his hood. Markiese smiles at this thought as he does more research on flight prices.\n\nBut this doesn't really do anything for the reader because there is nothing unique or intriguing that has been presented about the South Side.\n\nTo summarize, you are trying to do way too much with way too little. For flash fiction, you need to make sure each sentence has meaning and moves the plot. You don't get much to work with in terms of describing setting, character, conflict, resolution, or really any of the major parts of a story, so you have to do so quickly and with great description to make a good story. Flash fiction is a really difficult medium to work with because of how restrictive it is, so it requires you to focus on a plot and dive into it. It's not that this can't be done in a short paragraph, but that paragraph has to be extremely well developed. Take this example from Hemingway:\n\n&gt; While the bombardment was knocking the trench to pieces at Fossalta, he lay very flat and sweated and prayed oh jesus christ get me out of here. Dear jesus please get me out. Christ please please please christ. If you\u2019ll only keep me from getting killed I\u2019ll do anything you say. I believe in you and I\u2019ll tell everyone in the world that you are the only thing that matters. Please please dear jesus. The shelling moved further up the line. We went to work on the trench and in the morning the sun came up and the day was hot and muggy and cheerful and quiet. The next night back at Mestre he did not tell the girl he went upstairs with at the Villa Rossa about Jesus. And he never told anybody.\n\nHemingway though was a master of his craft, so he could accomplish writing a strong story in a single paragraph. It's difficult to do so without a great amount of experience with writing fiction because at that level, every word matters, not just every sentence. You would serve your story better by just focusing in on a single plot and thread and fleshing it out over a dozen or so paragraphs rather than attempting to cover too much in such a short space.",

Shelters are very inadequate in many aspects, not least of which is the instability and lack of security and available spaces (at least where I live, based on my mom's account of when she was homeless). \n\nSo let's imagine an alternative to it all. We have welfare or employment insurance, but obviously i's not enough or does not get to the people that need it most. A UBI would help, but given the institutions we have, making sure that everyone going through the doors of a shelter has assistance to receive that money, that's common sense. \n\nNow, given that appartments are really expensive in some cities, sometimes it's about relocation, paying off a debt, ignorance of available services, etc. So direct situational aid. But if we had a really solid guaranteed housing program, with buildings available to house someone as soon as they become homeless, man, that would go a long way. In my city, we pay 2 weeks of hotel for evicted people, and have free storage for a few month. That's very expensive and inadequate, but the net effect is that we (supposedly) have no homeless (I'm in Montreal and we definitively have homeless people here, but I was talking about Ville St-Laurent, a region within the city, which has the program I mention, and thus have no homeless...according to the maire). \n\nAaanyway. Nearly free housing. Cheaper for everyone. Guarantee the RIGHT to not die on the street because you temporarily lack money.\n\nMain message: [removed]",

They lived on his disability check, wic and food stamps. 3 weeks into the month, the money was all gone. Always. They'd use half the last gallon of gas in the car to get to the food bank and then spend the final week stuck in the house.\n\nWhen the checks came the next week, they'd pay as many bills as they could (depending on how much money they wanted to keep for fun that month) and let the rest roll over. When the ebt card got reloaded, they'd spend 75% of the money on the first day. I actually got to see first hand how this went, went I spent a week at their house.\n\nThirty seven bananas. She literally bought thirty seven bananas \"because they were on sale\" and they were her sons favorite. 4 days later, there were 33 bananas in the trash.\n\n4 gallons of milk. At once. Because \"her son drinks a lot of milk.\" Two gallons went down the drain when they expired the following week. \n\nThose are just the two examples that I remember the best, but basically the cycle was EBT card reloaded &gt; spend all the money on perishable items the first day &gt; eat half &gt; throw everything else away &gt; food bank &gt; repeat\n\nUBI might very well help a large number of people provide for their basic needs, but it absolutely won't stop people from being poor. You can't take someone whose spent their whole life barely getting by and hand them a pile of money every month and expect them to magically know what to do. It's going to take generations for UBI to have a meaningful effect on the way the lowest income families live. Poverty is more than just the lack of money, it's the lack of knowledge about money, the lack of experience with handling money, and the lack of any sort of financial planning (which is arguably a useless skill when you don't have any money above what you need to survive, so it's no surprise it's absent)\n\nUBI as a way to boost economic growth of an area through increased spending and tax revenue, absolutely. But UBI as a way to allow the poor communities to build personal wealth, doubtful.\n\nMain message: Bernice King and Elon Musk endorse new coalition of US mayors seeking to launch guaranteed income schemes in their cities",

The root issue is cost. It will never be addressed properly by collective bargaining. The market needs to be more efficient. e.g., more transparent prices, more competition, less barrier to entry, etc. \n\nOf course this involves the risk of allowing lower quality healthcare to enter the market. It's a risk that I believe is acceptable considering the current circumstances.\n\nI am biased because I am a software engineer with no degree or credentials. I think regulations and credentialism really hurt the healthcare industry, more than any other. My customers and I are lucky that the software development industry doesn't suffer the same fate.\n\nI agree to disagree as well. Thanks for the genuine questions though. Just to summarize my position, I think M4A is a good solution for the wrong problem.

(see hour 3 of part 4 of Countdown to Armageddon by Dan Carlin)(one could also argue that the airplane in WWII did the same thing: Much cheaper, new technology could sink much more expensive, older way of doing things).\n\nUltimately, I beleive that CPG Grey's horse analogy is correct.  There will never be zero humans employed, but those employed will be more for a unique situation or use (as horses are employed now.) Long before we get there, however, we'll see global upheaval long before then.\n\n3.\nhttps:\/\/smile.amazon.com\/Turing-Evolved-David-Kitson-ebook\/dp\/B00IHYV2LM?sa-no-redirect=1\n\nThis book is a scifi novel about a world where humans and AI live together.  It's interesting in it poses a unique problem that is solved by human labor: in that world, AI is very expensive, and easy to sue.  Thus, many jobs are still open for humans because they are cheaper labor and harder to bring litigation against. I imagine we'll have the answer to this within the next several years as cases vs. Autopilot (via Tesla) and other OEM autonomous driving solutions work their way through the courts.  \n\n\n",

Yesterday, there was an article on here about someone putting a down payment on a house with crypto. That's going to be more common. Somehow, crypto needs to be the currency we use.\n\nI can't imagine a stable financial system where everyone is going to buy $1,000 in bitcoin, hodl until it's worth $65,000 and cash out? How is Coinbase not going to go bankrupt eventually in that model? It's not going to work. Eventually, cryptocurrency will have a tipping point where it becomes our money, and the inflation created through coin staking is our income. I think this is decades away from actually happening.

I would love to take an unpaid internship or even an internship that does not pay well in order to gain experience in a city that has a large number of jobs in my area of expertise. I am by your measure highly educated i.e. I have a bachelor's degree in a highly marketable area . I cannot do that for one simple reason I can't pay for my livings cost and do that at the same time. Thus I am stuck where I am located and have a support network and must pass up those opportunities. You really don't get the basic advantage people with wealthy and well connected parents have over other individuals. A UBI will make a larger percentage of people able to be those that you deem climbers . Ironically, you appear to think that people don't want to better themselves which is not true. Provide people with a UBI and you will see very few of your so called blighted. And your assertions about UBI have been shown to be patently false in practice in the UBI trial in Canada most people worked only slightly less with young women working slightly fewer hours when their kids were toddlers. The rest of the people either continued with the jobs they had, started their own businesses, or went back to school to get more training.\n\nMain message: &gt; you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of how the job market functions these days.\n\nI don't think that I do.  There are basically 3 tracks for young people:\n\n**(1) The climbers**\nThese people go to university and get a highly employable degree.  They are driven and have high lifetime earning potential in fulfilling careers and so have a strong incentive to build those skills.  They are willing to work for very little  or no money in the short-run (internships) to get themselves into the middle or upper middle class down the road.\n\n*UBI: helps them bridge into their careers because education and internships cost so much, but then hurts them because they earn lots of money*\n\n**(2) The wanderers**\nThese people go to university and get a marginally employable degree.  They lack employable skills right out of university and either work a variety of low-skill jobs or go back for a more focused education in their mid-20s (nursing, teaching, etc.).  These people are having a hard time because they lack money, but also because their lives are falling short of expectations.  Most are sufficiently ambitious and for the most part they will work hard and not rely on UBI.  Eventually, by working long enough at various jobs or by getting focused educations, they are able to make it into the middle class.\n\n*UBI: helps them maintain their standard of living while they build skills and networks to boost their earning potential.  Pushes some people out of the skill-building track and into group (3)...*\n\n**(3) The blighted**\nThese people didn't go to university.  They lack employable skills and can only get jobs that pay close to minimum wage.  These jobs aren't great but you do build skills slowly.  Those skills may set you up down the road for something better, but it's a grind.  Basically these people are on the same track as the wanderers but the earnings curve is shifted way down.  The problem is that these people at age 20 may conclude that they can work for a pittance and by the time they are 30 have sufficient skills to earn a decent living, or just call it quits and live on the UBI.  I think lots of them would, and would continue to live on it indefinitely.\n\n*UBI: provides a strong incentive to stop working.  Helps a lot in the short run, hurts a lot in the long run.*\n\nThe actual answer is: raise the minimum wage, expand the EITC, government jobs, etc. to give everyone, but especially (3), a chance to work for decent money.",

They are whatever people think they will be. They are determined by expectations, but expectations follow no rational rules. If people believe that certain changes in the money stock will cause changes in the rate of inflation, that may well happen, because their expectations will be built into their long term contracts.\n\nThere may well be inflation, because of human psychology. But we can deal with inflation by raising all incomes in lockstep with prices. I would create basic income deposit accounts at the Fed for whoever asked. The accounts would be inflation-protected, so when you withdrew money you would get an amount adjusted for inflation. You could direct other income streams into the account so your salary or investments would be inflation-protected too. The idea is to signal to everyone that they will not lose purchasing power no matter what nominal inflation does. If everyone's fears of an inflation tax are calmed, why should the psychology of inflation take hold? \n\nMain message: [deleted]",

First, it must be pegged to the median income of society, not the lowest levels of income. To guarantee an income at the floor would simply perpetuate welfare standards and freeze into the society poverty conditions. Second, the guaranteed income must be dynamic; it must automatically increase as the total social income grows.

The world needs more garbage men, janitors, agricultural workers, and nursing home workers  than it needs artists and professional surfers.  The whole argument that UBI lets everyone follow their passion is comepletely childish and ignores that unpleasant jobs exist because they're necessary.\n\nMain message: This is a great example. In many cases, nurses do what they do because they want to do it. If we give a UBI to everyone, old people will have significantly more money to pay for care. Working may be optional, but there is still an incentive to work, especially if it's something you want to do anyways.\n\n&gt;So when work is optional, how do you get someone to decide, yeah I'll do that instead of being more poor and not working?\n\nWell for one, there is still incentive to work beyond telling people they will lose their home and starve if they stop, as it is today. That incentive is being able to legitimately improve your quality of life. Instead of just paying your rent and insurance, working will get you the funds to set up your own business, get luxury items, and invest in your passions.\n\n&gt;Old people are going to move back in with their families and YOU are going to have to take care of them.\n\nThis isn't a problem for me, but perhaps people with particularly unpleasant family members it certainly could be. I suppose you could do what people have done throughout all of history when they don't want to take care of their family and just pass them on to the next person. \n\nThen again, if you don't have to work, you can dedicate much more time and effort to helping them yourself, making the burden far less than it would be today, especially if you had access to their monthly ubi.",

The deconstruction of SS is likely to be expensive regardless of UBI or not.\n\nEven now, SS is going to move from a trust fund style system to a \"pay as you go\" one where benefits are paid out according to existing funding levels.\n\nSS was never \"you get what you pay in\"... it never could be that.  It's built on the premise that you'll die of old age before you collect what you paid in.... a calculus it doesn't seem to be doing too well in lately.\n\nMain message: Because you get out of it what you put in, to a degree. \n\nSo someone who worked their whole life and paid into the system is likely entitled to more than 11K\/year. Someone who didn't pay into the system - say a housewife - gets nothing. So there is this whole piece that appeals to a subset of the population where you only get $ if you contributed to society by working (not trying to get into a debate about housewife's working\/not working).\n\nSo, for UBI to work you'd need to be able to explain to someone who paid into Soc Sec their entire life why they're no longer entitled to their benefit and why someone who didn't pay into the system is now entitled to a benefit.\n\nedit: typos\n\nedit 2: In addition, soc sec was put into place to keep the elderly from dying in the streets, which used to be a thing. so it serves a different purpose than UBI, at least on its face. medicaid would pay to put someone in a home until they died so soc sec is pretty much covering the time from when someone can't work until they go into a nursing home. you could argue that UBI would accomplish the same thing, but you'd have to sell it during the transition period.",

It might give you just enough to maybe pay your rent or mortgage (or whatever important thing you choose to spend it on) so that\u2019s not something you necessarily need to worry about. After that is covered, you will still need money for other things which maybe you will work less hours for. Which frees up time for being a human.

If UBI allows that guy to work less, then I'm all for it.\n\nOf course I'm not happy about people working three jobs, but what I know is if a lot of people work and produce less the system will fail, and very quickly.\n\n&gt; Things aren't getting better for the rest of us.\n\nWell, yes, things are at least a little better for everybody, even after adjusting for inflation:\n\nhttp:\/\/media.cleveland.com\/datacentral\/photo\/11557873-large.jpg\n\nBut there is only one area that is consistently doing better year after year, and that is tax revenue:\n\nhttp:\/\/theneweditor.com\/uploads\/FederalSpending.jpg\n\n&gt; If you see the corporations' societal obligation to create jobs and opportunity to people and they don;t, the question isn't to try to kiss up to them even more, giving them more wealth. So if they fail to fulfill their societal obligations, I'm ok with the government taxing them and trickling that crap down themselves.\n\nNope, I don't see that they have any such obligation, where in the law does it say they have this? Oh, it doesn't. They exist to make money for their owners. As a side-effect of that effort to make money, they typically create jobs and grow the economy.\n\nAnd you misunderstand me: I have no desire to \"give them wealth\", but simply allow them to keep more of the wealth they create.\n\n&gt; Your attitude here is the problem with this country. Stop empathizing with the rich jerks abusing the system and start sympathizing with the plight of the poor.\n\nI actually don't give a shit about rich people or corporations. Most of them get that way through political connections and favors. This is not a system I favor. But more taxes, that also hurt those who earn their money legitimately, is not the answer. The answer is smaller government and less corruption.\n\nI do sympathize with the plight of the poor, and again, I'm not necessarily against UBI, but I am against destroying the economy for it, because that helps nobody.\n\nYou really misunderstand me if I'm out to give money to the rich and screw over the poor. My goal is completely the opposite (more or less the same as your goal), but you and I disagree on how to accomplish the same goal.\n\nYou say my attitude is what is wrong with the country, but truly what is wrong is that people like you and the vast majority of voters and people here on \/r\/politics just don't understand economics and motivation and think that the politicians will just save all of us, when in fact they are truly the ones out for only themselves and have all of the power they need to do it.\n\n&gt; Except you forget they're more desperate than you are. You have a labor surplus, they need your job. They'll take what they can get and you know it. The only way they'd refuse your job is if they have better opportunity somewhere...and businesses, given the opportunity, aren't gonna compete on a large scale. That just leads to a race to the bottom and lost profits for all.\n\nBy \"you\" I assume you mean the businesses, note that I'm not a business owner. Your argument is that businesses won't compete for employees... so how come most people make more than minimum wage? Why not pay everybody the minimum?\n\n&gt; Ever take an econ 101 class?\n\nYour condescending attitude is insulting and makes you look ignorant. I have a masters in economics, so yes, I have taken econ 101. I imagine you didn't pay much attention if you took it.\n\n&gt; There are legal constraints, sure, but we already have a welfare system, and it's constitutional. So please, stop making such a dumb argument.\n\nThe Constitution is always up for debate, as I said. Few Supreme Court cases are unanimous, most of the time there are justices that believe the opposite. Unfortunately, there has been a precedent that \"general welfare\" spending is legitimate, but many disagree, and there is no reason to assume UBI would be found constitutional.\n\nIf you feel the argument is dumb, it is only because you don't understand it.\n\n(continuing in a separate post due to the length)\n\nMain message: &gt; A lawyer or doctor today works 60-hour weeks, makes $500k, and keeps $300k. Now he makes $500k and keeps $200k. Is he going to work more or less?\n\nProbably the same. You're still way better off than living on UBI.\n\n&gt;A father works 3 jobs to feed his family now can feed his family without lifting a finger. How many jobs will he work now?\n\nWho knows, depends how much extra money he has to make. If he worked 3 jobs, that implies he worked more than a minimum wage work week. He might cut it down to 1-2 in order to maintain the same living standard.\n\nWhy are you defending the idea of people having to work 3 jobs to make ends meet anyway? Sounds like a horrible system if you ask me. If UBI allows that guy to work less, then I'm all for it.\n\n&gt;Yes, by just a tad (http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/corporate-profits-just-hit-an-all-time-high-wages-just-hit-an-all-time-low-2012-6), it isn't like they are just trending up continuously.\n\nThings aren't getting better for the rest of us.\n\n&gt;Why don't they spend all of those profits? Because there is too much uncertainty on future rate of return, that's why. Why take the risk?\n\nBecause it's not in their self interests, that's why. You're missing the point. If you see the corporations' societal obligation to create jobs and opportunity to people and they don;t, the question isn't to try to kiss up to them even more, giving them more wealth. So if they fail to fulfill their societal obligations, I'm ok with the government taxing them and trickling that crap down themselves.\n\nYour attitude here is the problem with this country. Stop empathizing with the rich jerks abusing the system and start sympathizing with the plight of the poor.\n\n&gt;Try offering such a low wage that nobody will work for you. Oh wait, you have no employees, and you go out of business, and you starve.\n\nExcept you forget they're more desperate than you are. You have a labor surplus, they need your job. They'll take what they can get and you know it. The only way they'd refuse your job is if they have better opportunity somewhere...and businesses, given the opportunity, aren't gonna compete on a large scale. That just leads to a race to the bottom and lost profits for all. Ever take an econ 101 class?\n\n&gt;Your claim was that rights could be changed at a whim. My point was there are legal constraints. And, yes, in my opinion (and yes, this is debatable), there is something in the constitution against basic income. \"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" The pre-amble does not grant the power to provide for the general welfare, only a general goal. The specific powers are itemized in Article 1 Section 8.\n\nThere are legal constraints, sure, but we already have a welfare system, and it's constitutional. So please, stop making such a dumb argument.\n\n&gt;So, mentioning the Constitution on \/r\/Politics makes me look ignorant? Isn't it a tad bit relevant? Doesn't it make you look ignorant when you don't even understand it?\n\nIt does when you go on about having a constitutional right to not be taxed.\n\n&gt;So if I become President and convince Congress to pass a law to tax you at 100% then you wouldn't consider that theft? Isn't there some expectation to keep what you have earned?\n\nI'd vote against him, to be fair, but hey, they legally have the right to do it. Don't expect me to wanna work at THAT rate though. I'd be okay with 40% though. If I'm on the low end, that's what's funding my UBI, and I'm okay with that. On the high end, why would I quit? I am making so much money I'm way better off than not working, even with the tax rate!\n\n&gt;If they pay it all, then shouldn't they be able to control how it is spent? Or you want them to pay it, yet you want an equal vote in how it is spent? How is that fair in your mind?\n\nOh please don't start that BS \"shareholder america\" crap again.\n\n&gt;I guarantee if you had to pay 40-60% of your income in taxes then you'd be whining as well.\n\nDepends what we got out of our tax dollars.\n\nHere's the thing, for the last 30 years, we've been fed this trickle down BS. That the rich will provide for the poor. Well, they're not, and because you're not, the government should take the money and provide themselves. I believe the rich have an obligation to take care of the poor...that was the lie we've been fed isn't it? Oh wait, I forgot, we value the rich person's right to be rich over that obligation, which is why no one gets done.\n\nI admit, I'm being very harsh here, much harsher than normal, but quite frankly, push comes to shove, I have different priorities than you. I believe that we have poverty because our mindsets allow for the poor to meet their needs, and I see mindsets like yours as obstacles. Crap will never change as long as we empathize with the rich and their first world tax problems more than the poor's right to eat. We expect the rich to voluntarily provide for the poor, then scratch our heads when they take advantage of the situation, pay their employees poorly, treat them like crap, and have massive bargaining power because if they don't put up with their crap, someone else will. Instead of saying, gee, maybe we should give the rich more incentives, maybe we should tax them and MAKE the wealth trickle down. They do hav e the overwhelming majority of it after all.\n\nHeres a game for you. It will only take 5 mins. Let's see how far you get. Have fun.\n\nhttp:\/\/playspent.org\/",

We can do that ourselves faster and with more accuracy, there is literally no economic reason to still have that middle-man.\n\nB) if someone's **only viable skill** is being the person who types people's orders into a cash register, **that person's labor** is not worth $15\/hr.  It's just not.  It's like paying someone $15\/hr to go get your mail from your mailbox every day, and if I suggested you pay someone that much to do that you'd look at me like I had three heads, not arguing that you should be paying them a living wage for their super important valuable service.\n\nIt's not about me or \"my liking,\" it's an unbiased quantitative valuation of labor just like we do for every job in every industry.  This is literally why a legislated minimum wage exists, because that calculation says to pay those people *even less* than they're already making because that job is worth *so little* in today's economy.\n\nMcDonald's is a business, not a social welfare program.  You want to argue for a UBI or social welfare programs to give these cashier workers more marketable skills that warrant higher pay in roles that actually *do* need to be filled (Like customer service managers, cooks, and cleaning staff at McDonalds)?  Sure!  Awesome!  That's worth discussing.  But that's **not McDonald's responsibility** and **not what's being talked about in this quote** and until those people do have skills beyond working a register then their labor simply is not worth $15+ an hour.  Which is what's being talked about in that quote.\n\nMain message: Alright but their job clearly isn\u2019t what you\u2019re saying it is then. McDonald\u2019s is a private corporation and have the option to try to use public relations to positively spin their use of iPads I.e. could\u2019ve went for the environmentally friendly angle or just say fuck it and continue using them anyway if their cost benefit analysis showed that people would eventually get the fuck over it and get used to it and keep eating their burgers. but they chose not to and chose to bring people back in. When they made that choice, it should\u2019ve been required that they also pay those people a living wage. Those people\u2019s job may not be cashiers it may be public relations associates who are basically assuaging the public fear of automation and AI taking over or whatever the fuck everyone is so afraid of\u2026 But either way they are providing The company a service whether that be taking your order or representing the company and should be paid accordingly. Maybe they found that customers come back to McDonald\u2019s more when they have friendly human interaction with cashiers either way that is still worth something and your comment reads as if the public can just absolutely force a company into doing something and they have no choice but to make these people slave away and work tons of overtime usually unpaid and dangerously that you say they could\u2019ve been using those iPads for. They could\u2019ve also chosen to make workers part time or some shit either way no one is forcing their hand in this but those workers are clearly there for a reason and deserve to be paid. Sure maybe you don\u2019t think typing orders into a computer and doing math at a cash register is a marketable skill so what if the job title was changed to your liking? McDonald\u2019s workers perform emotional labor all day that society clearly lost its shit without and if you don\u2019t think they should be paid for that thing your definition of work is skewed and you probably think mental health workers just sit there and twiddle their thumbs",

    "text":"Comment response: &gt;Q2 :Why not prevent the worst damage entirely, right now?\n\nGoing backwards helps the logic flow here.\n\nThe use of fossil fuels is one of the biggest technology leaps in humankind.  It's up there with use of fire, agriculture, movable type, and computers.  If we don't have fossil fuels, the impact is brutal, and deadly.  Before plastics, hospital equipment used to have to be cleaned and re-used.  So plastics are preventing tens perhaps hundreds of millions of infections yearly.  Hundreds of millions more in the food industry.\n\nTransportation isn't just travel.  It's getting life to places where life is difficult.  Food, health, housing, technology, all deeply involve fossil fuels.  I'm going to stop the benefits here:  I've seen 1,000 page reports that are incomplete on this issue.\n\nPreventing the worst damage is going to cost lives.  In the amounts that the most extreme activists advocate?  Millions of lives.  Cost increases that threaten literally billions more, particularly in the developed world.\n\n\\&gt;  So there's companies polluting the environment, and you're suggesting that they have enough profit to both support a UBI **and** clean up the environment. \n\nThe UBI isn't to increase people's lifestyle.  It isn't to 'help the poor'.  By putting in place a policy to start paying for the damage, we are ruining people's lives.  The UBI will be to help offset that, when your gas prices jump to $9.35 a gallon, and E5.50 per liter in Europe. \n\n\\&gt;   Even if the companies made enough for the plan to be viable, what's the  incentive for a company in a capitalist country to do either of these  things at their own expense? \n\nCompanies that do things in non-polluting ways will have massive price advantages.  The meat producer that pays the extra money to use methane-reducing feed will be saving much more by not polluting.  This type of thinking, in countless ways, will fund the efforts to reduce pollution all by itself.  We don't clean up because we aren't held accountable for being dirty.  Accountability makes being clean a reality.  And fossil fuels will end up being used for only the most valuable purposes.  \n\n\\&gt;  You've fixed the infection, but can never regain what was lost. A stitch in time saves 9. \n\nWe've already lost an arm.  Government programs are slow and inefficient, as governments try really, really hard not to 'hurt jobs' or 'increase consumer costs'.  If we start accountability quicker, those same incentives that have helped bring billions out of poverty can be applied to pollution control.  Instead of losing another arm and a foot, we can limit loss to a hand and toes.\n\nAlso, we underestimate nature, which is really good at healing itself.\n\n&gt; but Greta has never advocated starving, shutting off the electricity or a hard stop on all plastic use. I have not seen **anyone** seriously ask for any of that. \n\n*\"We don't need to 'lower emissions'\u2014our emissions have to stop,\" she  said, \"if we are to have chance to stay below the 1.5\u00b0C target\" set  forth in the Paris climate agreement.*\n\n*\"And until we have the technologies that at scale can put our  emissions to minus, then we must forget about 'net zero.' We need real  zero,\" Thunberg said.*\n\nThis is where I would say Thunberg is a naive teenager.  She doesn't realize what 'stopping emissions' means.\n\nMain message: OK this is actually a really intriguing argument, so I hope you'll forgive me for the wall of text.\n\n&gt; We grant that pollution damages, then charge for pollution. Then, give it back to people as UBI, probably holding some back to pay for actual climate damage, like to relocate the Pacific islands that get wiped out as sea levels increase. \n\nBasically you're suggesting we acknowledge the serious harm being done, but allow that harm to continue because the 1 profit will go back to the people as UBI, and 2 go to repairing the harm done.\n\n1 So there's companies polluting the environment, and you're suggesting that they have enough profit to both support a UBI **and** clean up the environment. Q1: Even if the companies made enough for the plan to be viable, what's the incentive for a company in a capitalist country to do either of these things at their own expense?\n\n2 At best, cleanup removes pollution. It doesn't bring un-kill the wildlife, it doesn't reverse the pollution, pacific islands still end up underwater due to sea level rise, and millions of people who live along the coast still become refugees. It's like getting an infection and then amputating your arm. You've fixed the infection, but can never regain what was lost. A stitch in time saves 9. \n\nQ2 :Why not prevent the worst damage entirely, right now?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt; Greta's message seems to be \"Stop if you love your children.\" And she seems to have no clue that her message is \"Stop eating food if you love your children\" \"Stop using electricity if you love your children\" or \"Stop using plastics (that prevent disease and a variety of other uses) is you love your children\". \n\nI have to ask if you read the whole article or just the headline, because this is an oversimplification and exaggeration of both Tuesday's speech and Greta's overall position on the issue. She's generally directing her comments at politicians, and business leaders, advocating for societal and state level actions rather than individual actions. Climate activists do advocate for eating less meat, using renewable energy, and reducing one-use consumer plastics (like straws and bags,) but Greta has never advocated starving, shutting off the electricity or a hard stop on all plastic use. I have not seen **anyone** seriously ask for any of that.",

So, you need to get a job which pays enough to cover your rent, bills and food or you are better off staying on benefits. So if someone offers you a couple of days work a week in a minimum wage job, you literally cannot take it. This is called the [welfare trap.](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Welfare_trap)\n\nWith UBI you get the basics covered, so doing 20 hours work in a (formerly minimum wage) McJob is a bonus, rather than a means to make you homeless.\n\nIOW, it can (and probably will) motivate some people to work more than they do.\n\nMain message: the point is there will be even more of them if you remove the stigma of being considered a useless human trash exploiting the system intended for people down on their luck and replace it with a \"god given right\".   \nThere is only one slider from 0 to 100%. % change means much bigger change in the dependency ratios.\nLet's say originally you have 20% coasters, 80% net funders and the change is 5%, meaning 25% coasters, 75% funders. That means that 5% change means dependency ratio going from 4:1 to 3:1 because it affects both numerator and denominator for that double whammy.\n    \nThe secondary effect of people dumping their more economically useful jobs to pursue economically useless dreams is nothing to be happy about either. The general prosperity is not built upon doing \"something\" with their lives.\n\nThen what you are going to do when people take their UBI money to let's say Eastern Europe where $$$ goes much further, allowing them to experience middle  class life without lifting a finger. Money being siphoned out of the economy funding the scheme is definitely not good.",

They starved while US investors and a handful of Russians got obscenely rich. Look at opinion polls of Russian attitudes to America from the early 90s and then compare that to polls taken a decade and two decades later. Our leaders could have shrunk our military and used the much talked about peace dividend to make the world better for people in the West and East. We squandered an enormous opportunity. Instead, we told ourselves we \"won\" the Cold War, even as our own population began to see growing inequality and wage stagnation, and wrote off 300 mil people as a has been power and ignored their suffering.\n\nAll that said, while I think there are some chickens coming home to roost, I think you are being a tad melodramatic. I'm not suggesting the US should be thrilled with Russia doing business with North Korea, but as the article mentions it is not even a sanctions violation, much less a sign of the end times that people in this thread are making it out to be.",

Rand and Ron Paul are not good examples of the core of Libertarians.  And the crazy Tea Party people,  while I'm sure they fall into that group, are also not a good definition.\n\nI think of myself as a libertarian socialist.  I believe in more and less corrupt regulation(not having 5 people to inspect 4000 oil rigs a year or some shit), increased civil liberties (guns, abortion, recreational drugs, gay marriage - Govt should just be completely out of marriage anyways).  But at the same time I don't mind increased taxation for social programs or to address global warming.  I believe we could reduce the military spending without losing our hegemony (which does have value if we don't abuse it).  I do not believe isolationism is very smart.\n\nI believe in good science - GMO, global warming is real, vaccines don't cause autism.  I also believe we need basic income.  I think it should probably not be provided if people choose to have kids though.  There has to be some incentive to reduce it's use or else we'll just keep encouraging population growth that needs to stop fast due to resource consumption.  Also we desperately need better tech for birth control and we need to make it free and flood the globe with it.\n\nMain message: I dont know. Personally I hate the libertarian view. just sounds like an easy way for corporations to manipulate the ideal of no regulation in their favor just like any other ideology. with that said, I somewhat trust ron paul, but Bernie Saunders is the only person that will get my vote for the presidential campaign despite the fact he will probably run for the liberal ticket if he doesnt go independent.

Although the consequential argument for a GMI is more easily made, the denetelogical one makes a lot more sense and is less whimsical, IMO. \n\nOne of the problems I've had with libertarianism is the concept of original appropriation.  The libertarian story goes something as follows: Man existed in nature with the commons, man mixed his labor with the bounty of the commons and the fruit of his labor became his property -homesteading. Therefore property rights, land titles, and mutual exchange are all moral stemming from that mixing of labor. Except that is not the fucking case at all - most land titles still come from the spoils of war or government grants or other un-homesteady means.  By private people owning the exclusive right to land, they are inherently denying others the right the bounty of the commons.  Why should private parties - and their descendants in perpetuity - be entitled to the bounty of nature, for example mining, just because they were the first ones to set up shop there? Since we are effectively barred from the commons, since we can no longer homestead [any of the federal governments godamned land](http:\/\/thepercolatorblog.files.wordpress.com\/2012\/03\/federal_land_map.jpg) we are denied the prosperity nature has given us for the benefit of the first ones there.  In the same vein, companies are permitted to pollute our air, externalizing the cost of their continued operations to the detriment to the rest of society.  \n\nSo how would a GMI be implemented in AnCapistan? Ultimately, I think a series of mass-class action law suits (in private courts) against those who have used the commons for their private benefit while excluding and in fact hurting others from its material wealth.  The right to pollute the commons [was granted by government](http:\/\/mises.org\/daily\/5978\/The-Libertarian-Manifesto-on-Pollution), an impartial court with respect for property rights that would develop in a free society would likely have to rule in favor of those being agressed upon.  The administration of the income due to people for not having access to the commons, and as damages for having their air and water polluted, would be ordered by courts and ultimately administered by private trusts to distribute the funds to citizens.  [The idea is basically borrowed from Agrarian Justice by Thomas Paine and was further developed by Henry George.](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Citizen's_dividend) you may want to look into [\/geolibertarianism] as its basically georgism with libertarianism.  \n\nThis argument is geared towards libertarians, so if you are not one or are unfamiliar or unconvinced by libertarianism or natural rights arguments, this explanation may not convince you .   \n\n\nHope this resolves any cognitive dissonance!  UBI is too important for the idiots at the dmv (or wherever) to be administering. \n\nMain message: Ancapism vs UBI",

Certainly in areas where supply is tight landlords could potentially push rents higher than they otherwise could've if the potential renters now have more money. \n\nOne of the benefits of UBI is it should increase mobility, and better enable people to relocate out of areas where the cost of living is too high and rents are high into areas where there is more slack in the real estate market. You'd have some upward pressures (having an extra $1000\/month would likely encourage some people to move into their own place instead of having roommates, increasing demand\/price) and some downward pressures (more renters could afford to buy, decreasing rental market, and more mobility to leave cities with saturated rental markets)\n\nMain message: What I don\u2019t understand about UBI is what\u2019s preventing landlords from simply raising the price of rent now that people have more money in their pockets?

Sending people back to work with inadequate PPE, no distancing requirements, and no enforcement when those rules are in place because they need an income isn't a good short-term solution while we need to continue working to keep the curve flattened. It's an ignorant \"solution\" that satiates CEOs and corporate execs complaining that they might have to report reduced profits next quarter to their shareholders and a government that is prioritizing those corporate profits over the general welfare of its population.\n\nThe better solution is for Congress to roll back the billions in corporate tax cuts that they \"earned\" by doing nothing (I know, I know, it'd never pass the Senate) and repurpose those funds for a recurring UBI for anybody who is underemployed, experienced a pay cut, or lost their job due to COVID-19.\n\nIt's a misconception that we, as a society, need to send people into a death trap because anybody \"has to\" work while this crisis is ongoing. There is a simple solution to keeping most people home and sustaining the economy until this passes and we have adequate PPE, treatment options, or a vaccine; and that solution is a recurring UBI.\n\nMain message: It's going to be a big issue in states and cities where they don't reopen schools in the Fall.

    "text":"Comment response: I never said real change comes from the top down. In fact, my position is exactly the opposite. When people vote for their preferred candidate, that's the change coming directly from the voter. Voting for the one likely to win is voting for top down change, as you're ceding the choice of what makes someone electable for everyone else to make. \n\nSaying the Democrats \"stole\" from Senator Sanders to add to the platform is a strange way to phrase it. It implies adopting views expressed by the voters is a bad thing. I'm not sure why you'd say it was stolen. In fact, the Democratic party adopting those policy ideas bolsters your position if anything, as the allegation was that Senator Clinton was more electable, therefore voting for Senator Sanders was a waste. While he was called less electable, his policies were also very popular with the party, so wouldn't that have added to her electability? It really is a strange position you're holding, and from what I can tell you were a Senator Sanders supporter, so I'm unsure of why you're contradicting that support. \n\nI've addressed the problems with voting pragmatically in past posts, but to reiterate; voting pragmatically cedes the positions you may hold and is implementing a rule on the game that only you follow. While the other side follows no such rule, it only works to shift where the middle is, allowing for your ideal positions to be further away from the electable middle. \n\nMy idealism doesn't need to get me anything in the short term. In fact, my ideal scenario would be a UBI (or a similar equivalent), no separate countries, (in the short term) no military spending outside of R&amp;D, and free education. None of that will happen in the short term, and while some of it is necessary for furthering our species in culture, intelligence, and procreation, voting for my ideals will never be throwing away my vote. It make no sense to ever allege a vote is thrown away (if we're assuming it's an earnest vote). Voting for Jill Stein wasn't to further an agenda, it was to lend my political voice to the view that best represented me in the general election. Your position makes it seem like I owe something to somebody because they got close enough. \n\nNot that it's particularly relevant, as the EC is a sham, but my vote is irrelevant in a general in Massachusetts. I don't particularly care for the idea that if you're in a swing state you don't get to vote your ideal, in fact I am against that as well, but my vote has absolutely nothing to do with the actual outcome of the election, which is a separate but also insane issue. \n\nYou say, \"failure to vote him out\", and I don't care for this attitude, either. That's the attitude that accelerated the President Trump phenomenon. Our system isn't made to work when the votes are all negative. Our branches of government were established to be partisan, but positive. When we have our positions represented as intended, the arguments are made at the representing level, not the voter. Voting against a candidate has yet to work in our republic. \n\nThe argument about which of the party candidates was the greater evil is another tricky one. For one party, the candidate had cheated as part of their bid to get the nomination. That disqualifies that candidate from my vote. The other party's candidate colluded with a foreign government which is cheating (and illegal), thus disqualifying that candidate from my vote. It's less about the greater evil in this particular instance than who is actually eligible for the seat they sought. \n\nHowever, to humor the point, let's assume both candidacies were clean and eligible. Yes, Senator Clinton is the lesser of the two evils objectively. That can't be questioned by anyone without some sort of pervasive greed, xenophobia, prejudice, or inability to critically think. This returns to a question which went mostly ignored by another poster. What is the breaking point of this mentality? I asked if the general election was Trump vs Pence, was it still my moral responsibility to choose between them? Let's bring it even further. If one candidate calls for a mass slaughter of everyone with blue eyes, while the other calls for the same for anybody with brown hair, who do I vote for? Is it my moral responsibility to vote for the one who will kill the blue eyes, as it's less people? \n\nSorry about arguing with so many hypotheticals, but it's kind of necessary given I disqualified both party candidate, regardless of alignment or positions. The main thesis is the same however.\n\nMain message: &gt;This is a short-sighted approach, though. It allows for the incremental loss of personal voice in politics. It eliminates a potential for progress, and tells politicians that their only goal is to be marginally more appealing than their opponents. It also tells you that no risk is worth taking to get positive change passed. Sometimes you have to be willing to lose. \n\nAll of those things are negligible for this election. Real change doesn't come from the top down, it comes from the bottom up. Incrementally. The real way to change is to hold politicians to the fire, make them hear our voice at the local and state level, hear our voice as we march in the streets or lobby the policymakers. Your idealism will get you exactly nothing if what you care about is ridding the establishment. As soon as your third party gets 5%, the establishment is just going to steal their platform. Like Hillary stole much of Bernie's. Like the Democrats stole much of the Socialist party's.\n\nIf you actually read Chomsky's words (they are dense, I had to read it three or four times) you'll see he made a solid point that voting lesser evil here wasn't short-sighted at all. It was pragmatic. Your idealism got you exactly zero, and I believe it will continue to get you zero. You're trying to create change by throwing your vote away... Well how did voting Stein advance your agenda, unless it was *solely* to tear down the Democrats? How would it have *ever* advanced the issues you care about?\n\nProgress is difficult, but regress is painfully easy. This was not the election to fall on your idealistic sword.\n\n&gt;To say I am indifferent to things President Trump campaigned on is kind of stupid. Several things he has said and campaigned on are not only plainly dumb, but indefensible notions against human progress. \n\nYour failure to vote him out speaks volumes, whether that's the message you intended to send or not. Let me be clear, I don't think third party voters shoulder the blame anymore than I think the Democrats do. There's plenty of blame to spread around. But the fact of the matter is your vote failed the fight against regression and if 1 out of 100 non-Clinton voters had voted for Clinton, she would have dominated the election and then we'd have a chance to hold an experienced, qualified president to the flames instead of an incompetent ass who is going to destroy America's image to the rest of the world.\n\n&gt;However, you assume your and everyone else's opinion weighs higher than mine by saying that. ... It's simply my vote. You don't get to choose for anybody else how they weigh or decide that. Alleging it was indifference suggests you think I should have voted on an issue important to someone else, opposed to my own. \n\nObviously this is my opinion. Many people think Hillary was the greater evil. I think this is *objectively* wrong and I'll vehemently defend that, but if you wanted to avoid the charge of being indifferent to the greater evil, you voted the wrong way.\n\nYou're \"supposed\" to be voting for what's best for America. Either Hillary was going to be president, or Trump, and no one else. In my opinion you had a moral responsibility to do the least harm to America and you dropped the ball.   ",

Stealing value from everyone.\n\nI'm still brainstorming, but UBI should be a public service.  As a public service, everyone gets some. It needs to be it's own currency, freely exchangeable for any other currency.\n\nThe free market will show the true value of a ubi.  There's some stuff to work out, since all I can see is people dumping it on the market, bringing the value to near 0.  I would think someone generous would have to be willing to buy, and probably see no direct benefit.. they would probably gain indirect benefits by improving the lives of others allowing them to be more productive.  This assumes that most people value improving themselves and others.. if everyone is greedy, it doesn't work.  Maybe with some extra incentives placed in the system it could restrict the greed aspect- still thinking about it.  And would need some people to code the whole thing.\n\nMain message: Please tell me why this basic income idea I had while frying eggs this morning will not work.",

    "text":"Comment response: &gt; When you say society will fall, what do you mean? Less government tax revenue? Lower birthrate? You can have a peaceful society with lower government revenue if business spending takes over, and a society with lower birthrate can result in less crowding and pressure on the environment.\n\nLower birthrates mean less tax revenue in the future as well as less business spending because there are less people employed, and less people paying into the government to support the increasingly aging population above them.  Yes, you can have a \"peaceful society\", but it's still a society in decline, and not the Western Society we once new.  Japan is a great example of this.  It's peaceful, but it's dying.  And there's no mass immigration due to their xenophobic ways (and justifiably so) to displace the decline unlike Europe with it's African\/Middle Eastern immigration and the US with it's Latin immigration, that both parties love to exploit for their own benefit.\n\nWhether or not technology automation will alleviate that remains to be seen, however government subsidizing of a increasingly under-employed\/unemployed population requires money to come from somewhere, and if this requires increased spending from businesses, you can bet your ass they will exert more political influence BECAUSE of the money they're investing, further divorcing the Western world from Democracy\/Republics into Corporatocracies or Oligarchies.\n\nMass immigration from 3rd world countries brings 3rd world poverty into Western Society, further requiring the governments to subsidize an ever increasing poor under-educated population with fewer and fewer people able to pay into the system to support such an absorption in the first place.  Another downward spiral.\n\nFurthermore, by eliminating the middle class that is able to absorb the ups and downs of the economy, you're now relying on a few at the top to subsidize everyone down below.  When the Economy goes into a downturn, and it will eventually, those select few may go belly up, which then puts immense pressure on everyone down below, to the tune of riots and food lines, and the ones at the top that have survived, if they do, will gobble up those around them and further solidify their control (JP Morgan Chase comes to mind).  \n\nAnd as for automation, you can find studies that say it'll displace anywhere from 6% to 80% of our jobs in the near future.  Even at 2\/3's or 66% of our jobs which I've seen recently mentioned, the Great Depression was a 25% unemployment rate.\n\n&gt; Many liberal democracies have successfully integrated Abrahamic religions into society well and moderated it, e.g. Australia, USA, Malaysia, Indonesia. \n\nIslamic societies within foreign nations HAVE NOT integrated well.  When you have a slow trickle of immigration, they are forced to integrate into the existing population.  When you have a mass movement\/migration, they form their own enclave, and while populations have done that in the past, Islam has had more radical tendencies that deter them from integrating than Christians within the recent past (We're not talking Puritanical birth of the 13 colonies here).  And since they don't integrate well, you have the people that migrated giving birth to children who ALSO don't integrate well, and then feel alienated from the general population and begin to identify with their home countries, and when they see the \"injustices\" of what's happening to their home countries while NOT identifying with the country they're currently living in, an Islamic Radical terrorist is created.\n\nAnd for you to site \"Liberal Democracies\" and a country like Indonesia or Malaysia in the same sentence is ridiculous.  The fact that you can be jailed or killed for even saying you're an unbeliever or godless or atheist COMPLETELY NEGATES \/ REFUTES the definition of \"liberal democracy\".  \n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING IN ANY OFFICIALLY ISLAMIC COUNTRY, so long as they're jailing\/killing non-believers.  PERIOD.  The US Constitution holds no religion above any other, though Christians Conservatives will try to tell you differently.  I'm willing to bet there's absolutely NO SEPARATION of Church and State in the aforementioned countries and whatever constitutions they have, deeming Islam as the official religion and rule of law.  \n\nHaving mass migrations from such countries as well as the Middle East\/Africa assures the destruction of current, true, genuine Liberal Democracies, the Western World AS we, the people who currently live in it, know it.\n\n&gt; A universal basic income is what many have suggestion should the robots take over all jobs.\n\nThis is a pipe dream in the near future, such like single payer healthcare.  For instance, California in the US is attempting to push ahead in the \"Healthcare for all\" realm ala Bernie Sanders and wants to implement a Single Payer system.  However, they have calculated the costs and it will be $400 billion annually at the least, which is more than it's annual budget.  Couple that with the fact that 2\/3rd's of its population is already on subsidized Medicaid Healthcare, so where would the tax revenue come from when the top and middle are already being squeezed to support an increasingly poor illegal immigrant population, that will also be under this \"single payer system\"?\n\nNow translate this to the greater US as a whole.  The costs are unreal, but don't let that stop head in the cloud liberals from saying it's possible, a long with no hunger, no wars, open borders, no hate, for all.  Fantasies and Fiction are great.  But the realities of the world around you are clearly ignored.\n\nMain message: &gt; hat happens when all the blue pills are gone, either through death or red-pill conversion? While we don't actively undermine society, our ability to go our own way relies on there being enough blue pilled men to stand up to do those things. When it comes down to it, MGTOW, especially the \"enjoy the decline\" types, are making the political choice to allow society to fall to whoever or whatever ends up conquering it (Islam? A.I.? Communism? A combination of those three?) rather than risk personal sacrifice to see to it's continuance.\n\nWhen you say society will fall, what do you mean? Less government tax revenue? Lower birthrate? You can have a peaceful society with lower government revenue if business spending takes over, and a society with lower birthrate can result in less crowding and pressure on the environment. Rising Islam is not a problem. Islam and Christianity are fundamentally very similar Abrahamic religions. Many liberal democracies have successfully integrated Abrahamic religions into society well and moderated it, e.g. Australia, USA, Malaysia, Indonesia. These countries are all majority religious. As for AI, more robots means humans work less, which I think is good, and some degree of communism will be necessary if we want to deal with the unemployment resulting from automation. A universal basic income is what many have suggestion should the robots take over all jobs.",

De som tror det ikke spiller noen rolle om de dukker opp p\u00e5 jobb eller ikke forst\u00e5r enkelt og greit ikke hva deres rolle g\u00e5r ut p\u00e5.\n\n&gt;Slik er det neppe - ein person som har 1 million i \u00e5rsl\u00f8n arbeider sjeldan dobbelt s\u00e5 lenge som ein som har 500 000 i \u00e5rsl\u00f8n, og legg neppe ned dobbelt s\u00e5 mykje innsats.

Du dyrker mat for Kalle, og Kalle bygger og vedlikeholder hus til deg. Senere m\u00f8ter dere Klaus som kan lage dekket\u00f8y, og Katrine som kan lage kl\u00e6r. Igjen, hver for dere er livet surt, men etter hvert som flere spesialiteter introduseres i \u00f8konomien deres blir livet bedre. Siden det er vanskelig \u00e5 bytte hus mot tallerkener utvikler dere en valuta, og kan begynne \u00e5 betale hverandre en type penger for jobben dere gj\u00f8r.\n\nEtter hvert blir dere kjent med Karsten, som er flink til \u00e5 tegne. N\u00e5 har dere en helt ny kategori gode i \u00f8konomien deres, nemlig kulturprodukter. Karsten mener han burde f\u00e5 like mye betalt per \u00e5r som deg og Kalle. Er det rettferdig? Hvis du slutter \u00e5 jobbe kommer alle til \u00e5 sulte ihjel. Hvis Kalle slutter \u00e5 jobbe kommer alle til \u00e5 fryse.\n\nVi spoler frem noen \u00e5r. Vi har en kompleks, hyperspesialisert \u00f8konomi. Et resultat av dette er at dere har avansert elektronikk, medisin og infrastruktur. Samtidig har vi problemer. Det er ikke lenger lett \u00e5 se at det er Kalle som gir oss et sted \u00e5 bo, og Karsten som lager tegninger til oss.\n\nI stedet har vi navnl\u00f8s kontorrotte 241, som ikke er i stand til (som ikke er rart, i en kompleks \u00f8konomi) \u00e5 se sammenhengen med at han kvalitetssikrer skjema AGDFS2345987 dag etter dag, og at vannforsyningen fortsetter \u00e5 v\u00e6re stabil uten at noen kan lure til seg noen millioner p\u00e5 fellesskapets bekostning. Noen av deltagerne i \u00f8konomien har rett og slett s\u00e5 spesialiserte funksjoner at de ikke selv forst\u00e5r helt hva det er de driver med, og begynner \u00e5 stille sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5l ved om de i det hele tatt gj\u00f8r noe verdifullt.

    "text":"Comment response: Of course not. What socialism would remove is the *coercion* to work, which 'motivates' people by plunging them into poverty, crime, violence and sickness if they don't (or cannot) work. These are brutalising and inhumane ways to treat people, and should not be countenanced by anyone with any concept of universal human rights - yet we accept them as the consequences of a system of private profit. As well, many people find themselves locked out of the labour market as it is - through lack of jobs, through wage depression taking earnings below subsistence level, etc etc etc. These are dynamics that could be abolished overnight in a society where we decide collectively how to apportion the value that our labour creates. Almost everyone would see a massive increase in their wages - cf, for example, that [John Deere workers would receive $142,000 each if shareholder dividends had been shared equally](https:\/\/inthesetimes.com\/article\/john-deere-strike-shareholders-workers-contract).\n\nI envision it that everyone would receive a basic income, housing, food, utilities. Then, you work for a high quality of living on a good wage - most people would either work a job a couple of days a week and pursue their passions with their free time (free education, access to artistic expression, etc etc) - or they'll make their passion into their jobs and not have to worry about falling into debt or becoming homeless if they lose their job. People who can work but choose not to can pursue whatever humanity-enriching pursuits they wish, and people who cannot work can be properly cared for. The impact this would have on society is immeasurable. You'd abolish the enormous mental anguish felt by millions of insecure people overnight - an anguish, let's not forget, which is justified as 'necessary' by capitalists who need a way to force people into working for poverty wages.\n\nMain message: Does Socialism take away incentive to work?",

    "text":"Comment response: Lol the predictable \"hurr then don't talk about our politics!\" speech.\n\nBut you said \"not that it matters\"? At least be consistent.\n\n&gt; Dunning Kruger was indeed the correct description.\n\nstop projecting :-)\n\n&gt; you're not even getting what I claim correct\n\nFunny how there's zero substance to your responses at this point, meanwhile I have on multiple occasions thoroughly explained and substantiated my stances and discredited yours - to which you have no response but to make unsubstantiated claims of foul play. Anyone can just read the chain and see I've directly addressed your arguments, and the fact that you keep claiming I must be \"mischaracterizing\" them yet you can never clarify what you apparently actually meant is telling. It's just a lazy tactic.\n\nFor example, you claimed the FD will cause \"sudden large price hikes\" - full context: \"MW will not cause sudden large price hikes because of the slow roll in, unlike the FD\". My direct response to this was to cite numerous case studies tracking the effect of mass cash handouts - none of which led to \"sudden large price hikes\" - and at least 2 of which actually had the opposite effect:\n\n&gt;in Kuwait, just as in Alaska, giving a large amount of free money to citizens did not only not result in increased inflation, but instead in decreased inflation.\nhttps:\/\/medium.com\/basic-income\/evidence-and-more-evidence-of-the-effect-on-inflation-of-free-money-a3dcc2a9ea9e\n\nAnd somehow according to you, arguing the FD will cause large price hikes \"has nothing to do with inflation\". \n\nThere's many more examples I can point to. Regarding the VAT paired with the FD: \"For most people it may be a net gain, but for those on welfare and social services, it would leave them worse off. \" You've made this argument multiple times. Again: \"With UBI there are people who\u2019s income stays the same but their expenses go up. That\u2019s a net negative for those people.\"\n\nMy direct response from the last comment: \n\n&gt;Yang wants to scale the benefits of these people according to the impact of the VAT (I know I know, you're waiting for this to be added to his platform officially).\n\n&gt;Even if he didn't, let me break down the other argument specifically regarding the VAT again. About 50-70% of VATs get passed to the consumer if you look at existing data on VATs, so that's a 5-7% increase on prices of VAT applied goods and services. But wait, Yang wants to tailor it to luxury goods and exempt or lower the rate for lower income consumer staples, as many countries with a VAT already do, so the effect on these people will be marginal - even less than the sum total of 5-7% even if the benefits don't scale.\n\n&gt;Then you have to consider:\n\n&gt;-household income - most of these people don't live in isolation or even are dependent on others - households will see a rise in income.\n\n&gt;-rise in non-profit work\n\n&gt;-huge failures of current welfare programs. Are the millions living under the poverty line with no or few benefits going to be worse off? Really? You can't just conveniently ignore these people to make your case unless you're operating under severe tunnel vision.\n\n&gt;-general benefits to society WILL effect these people. E.g. lower crime rates obviously will benefit the most vulnerable in society.\n\n&gt;-Yang's other policies that directly benefit the poor and directly compound the benefits of the FD like prosperity grants and universal financial counseling.\n\n&gt;-being able to opt into FD as soon as you start adulthood provides the financial security such that some will never even end up in circumstances where they require welfare.\n\nYou've also said nothing regarding all the failures of welfare that the FD rectifies, including lifting millions of the poorest people who receive few or no benefits out of poverty. This is yet again a piece of evidence in direct contradiction to your claim that the FD makes the poorest worse off, which is why you tip toe around it. \n\n&gt;  insults which you admitted were meant seriously\n\nYeah I do genuinely think you're being quite dense and a bit of an idiot, doesn't mean I'm upset.\n\n&gt; How many times now have you made the \"it's just a joke, bro\" excuse? Yeah, no. But you know what, maybe, you're right. It was a joke because literally everything that you say is a joke, hahaha. (Now that's how you tell a joke. Don't try to go into comedy, bud. You won't make it).\n\nYikes\n\nMain message: &gt; not American\n\nWell, then honestly stop agitating here, and have a good life. Or not. The minimal grace I had left for your bad faith arguments, strawmen, insults, and other ridiculous bull was because this might actually affect your life. It doesn't, so I don't care to care to correct your terrible understandings (again, on repeat because you're literally rehashing things i've already addressed) about how this policy will actually affect people's lives.\n\nMaybe stay out of our politics and stick to your own, but this also explains why you get so many aspects of how the FD, welfare, and other topics we've talked about so incorrect, lmao. Wow, smh. Dunning Kruger was indeed the correct description.\n\n&gt; Lol, not even italics will help your case here.\n\nYou are incapable of not making every comment of yours snarky, aren't you? Lmao. Insults or insinutaitons are just your norm, wow. I feel sorry for people you know personally, damn.\n\n&gt; the tracking is relatively minimal\n\nNo, it's not.\n\n&gt; this makes zero sense\n\nTo you.\n\n&gt; obtuse\n\nLiterally more insults from you.\n\n&gt; It was the first argument I addressed with you\n\nNo, it wasn't and your reading comprehension is terrible if you think my point has anything to do with inflation. Especially since I've told you multiple times that it doesn't. Oh well. You won't understand. That much is clear.\n\n&gt;  indicative of the exact opposite of what you claim\n\nLMAO, you're not even getting what I claim correct, so literally all you have are strawmen.\n\n&gt; I don't feel heated\n\nOkay, your insults which you admitted were meant seriously were you in jolly spirits. Continue to have a jolly good time elsewhere.\n\n&gt; clearly a joke\n\nHow many times now have you made the \"it's just a joke, bro\" excuse? Yeah, no. But you know what, maybe, you're right.

    "text":"Comment response: I really do appreciate the info. I am going to check all of these out In the next few days. You have really given me a reality check. It's kind of refreshing honestly. \n\n\nI plan to vote Yang in the primary election but I really hope the left can put up a stronger and more progressive person than Joe Biden. I will vote away from Trump if they get somebody that will actually do something for the people without the filter of government beaurocracy screwing it up. I like the idea of UBI because the funds(\"freedom dividend\") wont be tied up in some specific allocation. As far as Democrats go, I am also sick of the racism accusations, hoaxes, and prioritization. It cheapens the fact that real racists are out there with closer ties to the media that we consume than we realize. I am still stunned. Thanks again for the info. Hopefully you have spared me from future self inflicted cringe. Ugh.\n\nMain message: Hey no problem brother. I assumed you were just a fascist because they try to recruit on reddit a lot. I\u2019m glad you asked for some proof.\n\n I actually had a pretty similar experience to yours. I was pretty non-political for most of my life. Personally I\u2019ve always been a huge comedy &amp; stand up head, that\u2019s why I got into Rogan\u2019s show. Last summer I got really into Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris and Dave Rubin for about 2-3 months after they went on Rogan. I don\u2019t blame Rogan, he seems like more of a centrist. But watching the guests that went on Rubin and Sam\u2019s shows I started to get more and more into further fringe far-right people. I didn\u2019t get out of that rabbit hole until one of my buddies sent me links debunking them and now I follow it a lot because it\u2019s crazy to me to think I could potentially be one of those people if I went deeper down the rabbit hole. When I think about the weird sexist and Islamaphobic stuff I used to say when I was super into them I still cringe. So don\u2019t feel to bad.\n\nSo the way I think it\u2019s best to think of the alt-lite\/alt-right is as a sales-funnel or what some people call the \u201calt-right pipeline\u201d. Gavin and the proud boys are what would be considered alt-lite and they\u2019re kind of an intro into the alt-right\/all out white supremacy movement. They purposefully try to make conservatives think they\u2019re just normal conservatives so when someone comes out to protest groups like the Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer coming to there town, they can turn to normal conservatives that probably don\u2019t know how bad those groups are and say \u201cLOOK! PORTLAND WANTS TO BAN CONSERVATIVES FROM COMING TO THEIR TOWN! US CONSERVATIVES NEED TO STAND UP TO THESE EVIL ANTIFA AND SJWS!\u201d and Tucker Carlson will repeat it, and now a good chunk of normal conservatives are accidentally supporting fascist gangs. They tried to do the same thing about Charlottesville. They said it was about free speech and statues and \u201cthe left are attacking conservatives\u201d to try to make conservatives identify with them. My dad was saying that shit and was all worked up about it. But when you looked into the crowd there were Swatstika flags everywhere and people realized it was just a bunch of white supremacist. They pretty much try to pull that same scam now every time they go to terrorize a city. People like Richard Spencer (White nationalist) have openly praised people like Gavin as being a good recruitment tool for white nationalism\/neo-nazism. I can relate to [this video by Three Arrows and you might be able to as well.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/69obN625Fjs) He puts out a lot of really good videos. \n\nAnd what you said about people attacking Trump supporters in 2016 I agree with. I don\u2019t believe you should be able to go attack people you disagree with politically, but I can understand why it happened in some instances. If you remember he gave a speech saying Mexico wasn\u2019t sending their best people and said \u201cthey\u2019re sending rapists, and some of them are good people\u201d which implies that the majority of Mexican immigrants are rapists. I don\u2019t think that gives anyone a right to attack someone with a MAGA hat, but imagine how you might feel if you were a Mexican and someone that might be the president said you and your family are rapists. And you\u2019re probably already used to hearing racist shit about you as a Mexican. You might expect some of those people to be pissed enough to attack someone. That doesn\u2019t make it right, but it\u2019s not surprising. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not excusing it, but I understand what might cause it. I have Trump supporters in my family and I don\u2019t want them getting attacked or attacking anyone. The majority of conservatives reject Nazi ideology, but a lot of people (liberals and conservatives) aren\u2019t aware of how many they\u2019re are or they\u2019re recruitment tactics. It is good to see conservatives rejecting white supremacists though. The funny thing about white supremacists is once people find out they\u2019re basically Nazis they try to rebrand themselves. They call themselves white supremacists then rebrand to \u201crace realist\u201d until ppl figure out they\u2019re Nazis, then they call themselves \u201cracialists\u201d then \u201cidentitarians\u201d etc etc.  It\u2019s the entire reason Richard Spencer made up the term \u201cAlt-Right\u201d in 2015.\n\nAnother reason why Trump trying to classify Antifa as a terrorist organization is crazy and should concern everyone (not just people on the left) is because if you make protesting Nazis a terrorist act, that helps Nazis. Not to mention outlawing protest period is insanely UnAmerican and unconstitutional. We didn\u2019t see him condemn the Nazis that literally drove from out of state on buses to attack people, but we did see him tweet about locking up Antifa. Antifa protestors have killed 0 people, but the FBI has said white supremacist terrorists, like the one in El Paso and the Pittsburgh Synagouge are now the biggest terrorist threat we have. So focusing on the people that protest them seems crazy. Compare these two: [that United Front Nazi bus that drove in from Utah with Hammers ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/belowstudent\/status\/1162919216489648130?s=21)  with this tweet from the President that same weekend [about classifying the protestors as terrorists and never mentioning all the Nazis present attacking people](https:\/\/twitter.com\/realdonaldtrump\/status\/1162726857231544320?s=21) \n\n\nSome white supremacists main goal now is to try to sneak their ideology into mainstream conservatism. Tucker Carlson does this better than anyone in mainstream media. I thought his predecessor Bill O\u2019Reilly was annoying and a jerk, but he definitely was NOT a white nationalist. [Here\u2019s an article about how former Neo-Nazi and son of the founders of Neo-Nazi website Stormfront ](http:\/\/nymag.com\/intelligencer\/2019\/04\/ex-white-nationalist-says-they-get-tips-from-tucker-carlson.html) describes how effectively Tucker is getting their message into the mainstream.  Also here\u2019s a video [about how Tucker Carlson frames issues in a way that fellow white supremacist propagandist love.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/SkQKVMYyPoM)  Tucker is usually very good at his messaging and denying that he has any white nationalist views but he got lazy and pretty much showed his hand the day after the El Paso shooting (where the killers manifesto said he wanted to kill Mexicans to stop an invasion) Tucker said that our white supremacy problem is a left wing media hoax.\n\nHere [is another really good video about how alt-life people funnel white supremacist guests onto their shows.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/cXZ6BZzQeCQ) This might be one of my favorite videos on the subject by a YouTube named Shaun. He specifically cover Gavin in part of the video.\n\nI know that\u2019s a lot of links but they\u2019re all really good. I probably don\u2019t agree with you on some issues but I\u2019m glad we agree white supremacists are not cool lol. \n\nMy absolute favorite source of news &amp; reporting is [DemocracyNow. ](https:\/\/twitter.com\/democracynow) They\u2019re completely viewer funded so they cover a lot of stuff mainstream media doesn\u2019t. They don\u2019t take money from Big Pharma etc so they cover all kinds of things that CNN, FOX, and MSNBC won\u2019t. Oh and he\u2019s not technically a reporter, more of a commentator but you might like [Kyle Kulinski](https:\/\/twitter.com\/KyleKulinski) . He\u2019s been on a Rogan a few times now. I\u2019ll message you if I think of any more good reporters. Have a good one brother.\n\nEdit: Just remembered, if you have Netflix they have a REALLY good documentary called \u201cAlt Right\u201d. It\u2019s insane and super entertaining and Gavin is in it too.",

    "text":"Comment response: That's really too bad that you think your life sucks. I hope things turn around for you. \n\nI also work very hard for not enough pay and that's part of the problem for everyone, that there is quite enough money to go around, but it's not being distributed like it should be to ensure a society that doesn't live on the knife's edge. \n\nI'm not much of an advocate for a UBI because I think it would become another reason to blame the poor for being poor when they use the extra money to get by slightly easier without having treated the underlying issue that led to their problem in the first place, which is systemic. \n\nI think you're underestimating the amount of wealth accumulation at the very top of the society. When over 80% of the wealth gains have gone to the top 1% over the last few years (article on the front page yesterday I believe) there is absolutely enough capital to be spread around. \n\nThe truth is that there hasn't been anywhere near enough growth in wages over the last 40 years due in large part to the shrinking of unions and continued corporate consolidation of power in both the private and public spheres. \n\nWhen pseudo-oligarchs like the Mercers, Kochs, or Adelson can blow 23 million dollars on state wide elections without having to bat an eye (source us Jayne Mayer's book \"Dark Money\", but you could read any book about campaign finance and you'll hear all about it), they create an incongruency between the supposed points of emphasis for elected leaders (the constituency) with regulatory power and who they actually have to cozy up to to maintain their positions (the donation class). This creates a standard that says, \"cut my taxes or I will destroy you\". We've all read the reports about how a number of high level donors used their clout this way in regards to the recent tax bill. \n\nI bring this up because it is fundamental to the problem that a majority of Americans find themselves in. There isn't enough tax base or political will to provide legitimate programs to help the poor achieve a decent educational and public health outcomes. May it be the disparate graduation rates and post-K-12 admission of poor people and the rich, or something like the still unresolved Flint water crisis. \n\nI lived through it and I'm the only one who came out better than I started, the rest of my friends received a poor education with no planning or help beyond that \"a mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\". \n\nWe need job training programs, we need infrastructure development paid for by the state (worked in the 30s), we need better schools with better paid teachers and we need better minimum wages that won't leave people without benefits if they actually get a job. In the status quo a person is often kicked off of state assistance if they get a job so instead of striving for something better they often sit by because at least this way they have health care and food on the table. \n\nIf we want to change these outcomes we will have to pay a bit more of a price, and that means the people who have benefited the most are in a position where they are going to have to foot more of the bill. This is because we're all connected in this society. Businesses don't exist without infrastructure, and bankers don't become rich without usury. The problem is that the individuals are reaping the benefits of the system without giving back to the system what allowed them to flourish in the first place. \n\nSo, should we give all the poor people money? Maybe, but what we need to do is create a more fair tax base that utilizes that money in a way that helps alleviate poverty instead of treating that substantial part of society as a burden they wish would just disappear. This is because they won't disappear and their suffering does negatively impact you through wide spread defaulting on loans and multigenerational reliance on public assistance without a legitimate way to see a way out. \n\nMain message: [deleted]",

A UBI would allow them to get a better job to increase their income, a job that they like and get satisfaction from. *That's* the situation where people are starting to take care of others and engage in community work, not when they are miserable and afraid of the future.\n\nAnd nobody is going to get filthy rich from any kind of UBI. 12k a year adds up to 840k over 70 years. Today's moderately rich people make that in just one year. Filthy rich people wouldn't even get out of bed for it.\n\nMain message: UBI isn\u2019t going to fix any of  that. In fact it will do the opposite. If you run UBI, real UBI, for long enough and it will create a two class system of workers and owners with no way to hop from one class to the other. Why? At the bottom, people who get UBI need every dime to have a roof over their head. They spend every dollar. But part way up in the middle class, the UBI is just extra cash that looks like an trust fund payment that they can put into long term investments and make even more money.  Even if working Dad\u2019s UBI washes out, non working Grampy and granny and stay at home mommy can give junior their UBI - giving him income of a full time working adult as an infant, all poured into long term investments, making him incredibly wealthy without ever paying into the system - ever. Because by the time he\u2019s moved out, he\u2019ll have so much money that he doesn\u2019t need to bother working.  The only people working are the people who have to. And their taxes would keep going up to pay the UBIs of rich and poor alike. ",

At most you can conclude that they might not be as profitable as they currently are.\n\nThey already have a very small profit margin. A significant increase in their labor costs would force them to raise prices, which means less sales, which means even worse profit margins due to fixed costs.\n\nThis doesn't mean there wouldn't be anyone serving that market. I expect it would look more like how it was before the \"walmart revolution\", with smaller stores and noticeably higher prices, and some charity thrift stores.\n\n&gt; How is current public anger about lobbying and special interests \"buying\" legislation affecting reelection rates? Last I checked, they're still running over 80%. \n\nPeople don't like what they're getting, but they like it better than the alternatives.\n\n&gt; That's why most special interests spread the money around to most everyone.\n\nRon Paul got a big chunk of his donations from financial industry, branches of the military, and other government agencies. How much is it affecting his decisions?\n\n&gt; Remember that regulations are a form of kickback to special interests.\n\nThey most certainly are! One of my most hated forms, personally.\n\n&gt; \"Private academies flourished in the towns across the country, but rural areas (where most people lived) had few schools before the 1880s.\"\n\nFrom the same wikipedia page: \"From 1910 to 1940, high schools grew in number and size, reaching out to a broader clientele. In 1910, for example, 9% of Americans had a high school diploma; in 1935, the rate was 40%.\"\n\n&gt; Are you saying that you believe that homes that the TVA ran electricity to would still, to this day, be stuck with only generators for power had it not been for those public works programs?\n\nGoodness no. Govt may have accelerated the spread of electricity to those areas, but it would have happened anyway. I was saying that even at worst, low-density areas that can't be profitably connected to a large power grid without govt intervention, could still run on generators (or small local grids).\n\n&gt; I wish the rest of the public took that rational perspective.\n\nMe too, but realistically I would sooner bet on apathy.\n\n200 schools were closed in BC since 2002. There was a lot of noise from the teachers union and some of the parents affected, but I don't think there was much outcry from the general public. Some years later, the woman in charge of those closures, just got elected to run the provincial government.\n\n&gt; Yes, and I know you think that's abhorrent. I don't.\n\nNeither do I, but I think many activists on the left do.\n\nSo long as there are alternatives as \"good\" as current public schools, I think most of the public would just shrug and move on. That's pretty much my ideal as well.\n\n&gt; I simply have more of an issue with a student (or his\/her parents) taking their voucher and trying to legally force a school to take them.\n\nI get that, but my views differ.\n\nIf it's privately funded, govt shouldn't be allowed to interfere, at all.\n\nIf it's publically funded, I have no problem with enforcing public access *if that's what it takes for vouchers to replace public schools*.\n\nAlso I see education as a state issue at most, and not federal. That means some states could skip the non-discriminatory clause if their local population doesn't mind, and then we could see what happens.\n\n&gt; I was drawing the parallel to areas where students who choose to attend public schools can ONLY attend their local school within the district in which they live.\n\nOk, I get what you were saying now. I still think it's stupid that people can't bring their kids to whatever school will take them, regardless of district. I fail to see any utilitarian value in such restrictions.\n\n&gt; I have no doubt that people would be (wrongly, IMO) claiming that suggestions to simply end that govt monopoly would result in the poor having NO options instead of recognizing that low-income consumers are a target market for many businesses to pursue. \n\nIncrementalism can work both ways. The trick is how to transition to a free market without spooking people at any step.\n\nThink of GovCo having a monopoly on subsidized food. First add a food stamp program to even the playing field, and let the market serve up some groceries. Shift regulation to local govts, then experiment with deregulation. By now there are plenty of private alternatives, and if GovCo is inefficient they will be unpopular with consumers, so gradual cuts (5% per year) should be easy. Within 20 years you have a whole generation of voters who don't know why GovCo even exists, making it easier to eliminate it entirely.\n\nOh no, now you're stuck with food stamps! No problem. Deleguate the food stamp mandate to local govts, and experiment with cuts. Let individuals choose between food stamps or a smaller amount of cash - most will choose cash. When there's hardly anyone using the food stamp program anymore, you can kill it without causing a riot.\n\n&gt; I'm pointing out that we cannot discount those new approaches, new methods, new opportunities that don't exist currently under the govt monopoly of subsidized public education, but that are likely to arise if it were eliminated.\n\nI understand that and agree wholeheartedly, but how can people trust the market if those options aren't there yet?\n\n&gt; There are schools NOW that cater to the poor. And even before govt got into the higher education loan racket, scholarships existed for those in need at both levels.\n\nSo, how can that be extended to make it a credible alternative?\n\n&gt; Plus, while you may consider it dangerous, I think that a church willing to offer massively discounted education in exchange for weekly church attendance is a reasonable offer that many people will accept - despite not being Christian.\n\nI'd consider that a very reasonable and generous offer myself, and not at all out of character for religious institutions in general. I think that religious organizations did a lot of good over the centuries, and notably the Cistercians don't get the credit they deserve for planting the seeds of the industrial revolution.\n\nMy worry is what happens **if it's the only viable option**, because businesses can't compete with ChurchCo any more than they can compete with GovCo.\n\n&gt; As I said, vouchers are a good first step. I don't think that will solve all our problems - especially since politicians and unions and advocates of public education have the power of govt to slant things.\n\nOne step at a time.\n\n&gt; I don't know enough about the mechanism and structure of UBI to form an opinion of it yet.\n\nIt's the ultimate no strings voucher. Give poor people money, and let the market do the rest. Sure a rare few will stop working or spend it all on booze, but is it really worth screwing up the rest of society to prevent that?\n\n&gt; I know in many cases, they change management, they have state administrators come in instead of local ones, they get more funding, and they continue.\n\nThe schools are bad but the kids are still in them. Give them alternatives, and the schools will be empty. Nobody to hear them fall.\n\n&gt; Yes, absolutely! And often, far too frequently, in horrible ways. Politicians respond to pressures that are often the OPPOSITE of the negative feedbacks on bad behavior that they should have 1 - 2.\n\nHorrible to who? While approval of congress is very low, approval of individual congresscritters in their district is high. Think about that, real hard.\n\n&gt; And worst of all, you have no choice. You cannont choose to buy your govt services from a different govt. You either obey their rules or you go to jail. The only other option is to leave their jurisdiction altogether.\n\nYes, and I know you think that's abhorrent. I don't.\n\n\nMain message: &gt; My point was that Walmart++ aren't a good counterexample because their business model wouldn't be viable without market-distorting govt subsidies.\n\nYou can't conclude they wouldn't be viable. At most you can conclude that they might not be as profitable as they currently are.\n\n&gt; Special interests are of little use to a politican who can't get elected.\n\nHow is current public anger about lobbying and special interests \"buying\" legislation affecting reelection rates? Last I checked, they're still running over 80%. \n\n&gt; Politicians have even less reason to care about special interests that only support their competitors.\n\nThat's why most special interests spread the money around to most everyone. Look at the last presidential election. Wall Street, who most considered to be obvious Romney supporters, donated almost evenly between Obama and Romney. \"Hedging their bets\" as it were.\n\n&gt; Enforcing regulations costs money, services cost money, cutting into either is an easier way to find money for other special interests than raising taxes.\n\nRemember that regulations *are* a form of kickback to special interests. Regulations that increase barriers to entry and make new competition extremely expensive to start \n\nFair enough. I read it in an actual book quite a while back and can't remember the title, but a quick search found [this page](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/History_of_education_in_the_United_States#Growth_of_public_schools) in Wikipedia that, while certainly not authoritative, does reiterate what I said: \"*Private academies flourished in the towns across the country, but rural areas (where most people lived) had few schools before the 1880s.*\"\n\n&gt; Generators.\n\nAre you saying that you believe that homes that the TVA ran electricity to would *still, to this day*, be stuck with *only* generators for power had it not been for those public works programs?\n\n&gt; If within a few years public schools look like haunted houses, close them.\n\nI wish the rest of the public took that rational perspective. More than likely, however, they will decry the, say, 5% of students that still choose to go to that school and claim they will either be forced to go to a school that \"doesn't want them\" because of low grades, behavior problems, race\/income\/religion\/whatever other excuse, or forced to go to a school that is somehow a hardship (i.e. further away, opposite direction of work, etc). Not to mention all those teachers, administrators, and other employees that would be put of a job should the school close. I'm sure some complicated \"state\/federal takeover\" or somesuch that will bring with it more funding will be recommended.\n\n&gt; True, but individuals who are openly atheist (or other religions) or critical of that particular religion may be refused service.\n\nYes, and I know you think that's abhorrent. I don't. Nor do I have an issue with a atheistic or even satanic school refusing to accept an outspoken Christian. I honestly believe it would be rare that such a student would be clamoring to become accepted in such a diametrically opposing school, but beyond that, I simply have more of an issue with a student (or his\/her parents) taking their voucher and trying to legally *force* a school to take them.\n\n&gt; Ok now I'm confused. Legal problem or availability problem? If legal problem, my statement stands. I fully support breaking any legally protected govt monopoly in economic activities.\n\nI was drawing the parallel to areas where students who choose to attend public schools can *ONLY* attend their local school within the district in which they live. Like I said, probably strained the comparison and made it more confusing than anything.\n\n&gt; What kind of libertarian ...\n\nThe point of the analogy wasn't the economic viability but the point that there *are* retail businesses that target and cater to low-income consumers and that **if** somehow that market had been monopolized by govt in a similar fashion to public education, I have no doubt that people would be (wrongly, IMO) claiming that suggestions to simply end that govt monopoly would result in the poor having NO options instead of recognizing that low-income consumers are a target market for many businesses to pursue. \n\n&gt; How would private school prices be lower, if they already can't provide a comparable education for the same price?\n\nI don't think you're really understanding the analogy. The point is that under a Gov-co situation, the only, say, dishwashers that people could buy NOT from Gov-co would be $1500 models that can clean every spec of food from even a full dish of lasagna in about 5 min - silently. Even cheap models cost $100 to manufacture. So when Gov-co sells them for $10, no private business could cover that price and still remain in business. But get Gov-co out of the way and you suddenly start seeing things like refurbished dishwashers for $30. The used dishwasher market blooms. Etc. People start finding options to cater to those that need it by offering new approaches than existed (and were not viable) under Gov-co. \n\nI'm pointing out that we cannot discount those new approaches, new methods, new opportunities that don't exist currently under the govt monopoly of subsidized public education, but that are likely to arise if it were eliminated. The retail market is the example of that.\n\n&gt; What about low-income families who are paying less taxes (for education) than what they receive (in the form of education)?\n\nThere are schools NOW that cater to the poor. And even before govt got into the higher education loan racket, scholarships existed for those in need at both levels.\n\nI don't see why that wouldn't exist in a non-govt situation. In fact, it's likely to expand significantly. Plus, while you may consider it dangerous, I think that a church willing to offer massively discounted education in exchange for weekly church attendance is a reasonable offer that many people will accept - despite not being Christian. To go a more secular route, I would be surprised if you didn't have various civil groups that would offer to pay for a student's education in exchange for participation in community service\/outreach programs. \n\n&gt; Vouchers or UBI would make it an even playing field without leaving the poor out in the cold.\n\nAs I said, vouchers are a good first step. I don't think that will solve all our problems - especially since politicians and unions and advocates of public education have the power of govt to slant things.\n\nI don't know enough about the mechanism and structure of UBI to form an opinion of it yet.\n\n&gt; As often as a politician can get away with throwing that money at some other lobby or special interest group.\n\nThat's a vague answer. I don't think schools get closed nearly as often as people tend to think they do. I know in many cases, they change management, they have state administrators come in instead of local ones, they get more funding, and they continue.\n\n&gt; What it does do is respond to different pressures than businesses, private charities, unions and churches.\n\nYes, absolutely! And often, far too frequently, in horrible ways. Politicians respond to pressures that are often the OPPOSITE of the negative feedbacks on bad behavior that they should have [1](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fGOj8kBpsD4) - [2](http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6uR4lqa7IK4).

    "text":"Comment response: &gt; If the population stays the same, you might have a point, but the US population has TRIPLED since suffrage.\n\nOne, my example numbers are from 1970, not sufferage.    \nTwo, my numbers ARE taking into account the population growth. There is 17% more of the total female population today that's 16 and older that's working or seeking work than there was in 1970. Like I said, if 43% of the potential female work force worked like in 1970 instead of the 60% today, there would be roughly 30 million less workers (as in 30 million less today than it is now, not 30 million less than in 1970). Considering the sizable unemployment that still plagues the country and the lowered wages from the pressure of a hefty labor pool, this is putting dramatic downward pressure on wages for both working men and the remaining working women.    \n    \n&gt;  Women joining the workforce along with men opened up more jobs in support fields, everything from daycare to house cleaning to health care fields.    \n    \nThis may be true, but I can't see how that either justifies the massive jump in unemployment or cheap labor. We can talk about a lot of things that this is actually a problem for (value of in home raising of children vs. none, general home care, social benefits of having a stay-at-home spouse, etc), but honestly these don't carry a clear, direct economic effect (even though they do carry a massive, dramatic effect in the long run, but that's for another topic). In either case, all you're really saying is that by having more women in the workforce, we've created more jobs to fill the positions that stay at home moms left.    \n    \n&gt;  This offsets a great deal of what you seem to be talking about. Note also that women often don't compete for all of the same jobs as men    \n    \nThis is true. Construction, emergency services (firemen, policemen, etc, and yes, I know I put \"men\" instead of \"person\"), and a whole mess of other fields that are more technical or science based are male dominated and don't look to be shifting anytime soon. However the first two are obviously dangerous and call for physical ability that are not as common in women and the last isn't a range that many women care about, for whatever reason you'd like to conclude. You still don't see men taking up secretary, waitress, or elementary teaching jobs in the droves, though. This still ignores the majority of jobs that are pretty close to evenly split, or even increasingly favoring women. Once again, these are not really men leaving the fields, but more about women encroaching into these markets in numbers. And once again, this drives down wages.    \n    \n&gt;  Articles and studies like these make a very clear point that women in the workforce have a net INCREASE in GDP for these nations.    \n    \nNo duh. If you throw in child labor, you'll get even more GDP. Might as well pull people out of retirement and squeeze them for all they can produce too! We're not talking about GDP. That has nothing to do with this topic, but it's a no brainer that the more workers you have, the more GDP you have.    \n    \nGetting more on point, it's not so surprising to see that [real wages](http:\/\/www.theresilientfamily.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/10\/Real-Wages-Long-Term.jpg) have stagnated pretty consistently with how much women have entered the workforce. Also not at all surprisingly, this lowers the ability of one person to support a family, leading to both parents (or adults if no children) working, increasing the labor pool, and further pushing the problem out until two working adults cannot afford common comforts (and I think we can all agree that this is the case for many today). The only reasonable way (without basic income being a factor, but even with) to turn back this effect is a smaller labor pool to offset that massive increase by so many women entering it.\nYour article does nothing to help address the issue either. In fact it touches on point that along with the benefits of more working women, there's a clear and obvious collection of problems associated with it. I also like how it more or less equates to an opinion piece, but again, that's not the point.\n\nMain message: &gt;It also can't be denied that a larger labor pool means lowered wages.\n\nIf the population stays the same, you might have a point, but the US population has TRIPLED since suffrage.\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demographic_history_of_the_United_States\n\nSimilarly, the US remains one of the only nations on Earth going forward that has a net INCREASE in population due to birth rates and immigration.  \n\nAll of this means that there are more people to perform work, but also that more work needs to be performed.\n\nWomen joining the workforce along with men opened up more jobs in support fields, everything from daycare to house cleaning to health care fields.\n\nThis offsets a great deal of what you seem to be talking about.  Note also that  women often don't compete for all of the same jobs as men and that there are still a huge percentage of men AND women who now take on the role of homemaker (instead of just being primarily women) and what you've seen is a SHIFT in employment gender, not a collapse of wages due to a flood of employees.\n\nArticles and studies like these make a very clear point that women in the workforce have a net INCREASE in GDP for these nations.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/lisaquast\/2011\/02\/14\/causes-and-consequences-of-the-increasing-numbers-of-women-in-the-workforce\/\n\nDo you have any hard data to support your assumptions?",

It's indistinguishable from a self-protective view someone would have to keep from having cognitive dissonance about their ideology not being more popular.\n\nThat is true.  And I have no way of knowing for the same reasons. \u2206\n\n&gt;Again, speaking personally: Libertarian terms like \"limited government\" or \"economic freedom\" have absolutely no positive emotional impact on me. I hear that and I'm just eh. So when I talk to someone who values those things on their own merit, there's a way in which it doesn't matter if they're Gary Johnson or Ayn Rand: in a way, they're speaking Greek to me.\n\n[Rand herself called libertarianism a greater threat to freedom than modern liberalism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Libertarianism#Objectivism), so I don't know why her views keep getting propped up as speaking for libertarians.  \n\nSo you hear some terms that don't impact you emotionally and you stop listening?  That is what I would be talking about.  There are other terms associated with libertarians and the current Libertarian candidate, like \"protect the environment,\" \"basic income,\" \"end corporate subsidy,\" and \"non-interventionist foreign policy,\" that maybe sound more like English to you (totally projecting what terms might appeal to you), but you can't hear it because you already went \"eh.\"  \n\nMain message: &gt; It's not brainwashing as much as it is the extreme difficulty for presenting any political views that aren't from the main two parties.

It's indistinguishable from a self-protective view someone would have to keep from having cognitive dissonance about their ideology not being more popular.  Only you know if that's true, I'm just saying that it looks similar from the outside.\n\n&gt; I can agree with that. However, I don't think Gary Johnson is one of the horrible loud libertarians, yet the things he says are just as easily dismissed.\n\nI recognize that Johnson is different from the kinds of people I'm talking about.  But speaking personally, I have just as easy a time dismissing his views.  He wants to deregulate more than I think would be a good idea; he inherently values privatization and economic free marketism more than I do... I don't need to caricature him to recognize he's not up my alley.\n\n&gt; value compassion above all else? Does that mean other people can't? Are compassion and freedom really at odds with each other? Saying Republicans value sanctity paints them all as religious which I don't think is true either.\n\nFirst of all, just as an aside, sanctity doesn't necessarily imply religion.  (I won't get into my personal theory that many millennial so-called libertarians are actually just non-religious conservatives who think that's a paradox.)\n\nAnyway, what I said is definitely an oversimiplification, and these values are NOT in conflict much or most of the time... and everyone values all three, to some extent.

If businesses aren't able to compensate after all these years of stagnation, then that's too bad. I call mega bullshit.

There's no reason a person like Bezos doesn't have to pay taxes, while the rest of us pick up the slack. Stop the endless wars, that'll free up a significant chunk of cash. Crack down on the outsourcing of American jobs. Fix our healthcare model, we're the most expensive country in the world to get healthcare. Follow the money, fix it. Get rid of the income tax for all those making under $200k\/annually, and raise it for those who do. Reduce the amount of irresponsible government spending. I think some city in Canada spent quite a deal of money on a giant inflatable yellow duck that sits in a giant lake. Let's not do dumb shit like that. Or paying $640 for a toilet seat. And stop giving countries overseas so much of our money in aid. We don't have it to begin with. Why the fuck does Israel get to have universal healthcare and college when we're giving them $3,800,000,000 annually? That's like $10m a day.

And newsflash, these unfortunate people aren't going to just roll over and die. The lootings and uprisings are only going to get worse, right now we're just experiencing mass Unemployment\/Underemployment \"Lite\". Pretty soon sports and reality TV won't keep the poor masses entertained anymore. Even the Romans understood this. Shit's gonna get ugly when the working class doesn't have jobs anymore. Not everyone's cut out for skilled labor.\n\nI don't know if I wholeheartedly support a death tax, since I think unfortunate people already depend on their parent's inheritance for posterity.

This is broad terminology, but he\u2019s mentioned it not being on diapers, paper towels, and bread (just as a few example, not an entire list). \n\nAlso, many economists have conflicting opinions on if rent will go up just because if rent is too high in one area and people have more funds, they will move. Property prices are also expected to go up, and then eventually stabilize because there will be a great demand in construction, many houses will be built to keep up with this demand, and demand will eventually go down. There will be rent-seekers, but there will also be competitors who\u2019s houses no one is renting and need people to buy. \n\nInflation is also generally created when money is straight up added into the economy. The money won\u2019t be created, just redistributed. \n\nGranted, this does not fix the overall income inequality. But think of this, every google search you made today is free data for google to make money. Data is just as valuable as oil in today\u2019s economy (I know a typical Yang line but the stats back it up). You see none of that. Sure you get to use this platform for free, but it isn\u2019t a fair trade off. People make some free searches, they make billions. Surely we should receive some of that money and think of something that can take a portion of that for us. Andrew Yang\u2019s VAT tax will apply to those situations. \n\nYang is not against taxing the wealthy more. He\u2019s said many times he supports the spirit of it. Hell, Yang said he was a Bernie supporter in 2016 before he decided to run. The thing is, these people move their assets in extremely clever ways. They\u2019re smart and will dodge the wealth tax somehow. \n\nI feel bad for not having the links to some of the things I\u2019m saying, I\u2019m admittedly at reddit lol. However, the buying power of the bottom 94% of Americans will be increased. UBI is going to be necessary soon as many people are losing their jobs. My own parents have lived a fairly paycheck to paycheck life and both of their jobs are expected to be lost to automation in the next 5-10 years. With little retirement savings because the life they had to live, UBI gives me hope they\u2019ll have a cushion along with social security which Yang is keeping. I support Yang a lot because of this as well.\n\nMain message: https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/policies\/value-added-tax\/\n\n&gt;**A Value-Added Tax (VAT) is currently used by 160 out of 193 countries**, including every developed nation except the US, because it is a more efficient way of generating revenue with no loopholes. Big companies and rich people are excellent at moving assets around to avoid taxes \u2013 Amazon, Google, and other companies funnel hundreds of billions in earnings overseas. In fact, Amazon paid zero in taxes last year. **A VAT makes it impossible for them to benefit from the American people, automation, and infrastructure without paying their fair share.**\n\n&gt; **By implementing a VAT, the American people will get a tiny sliver from the transactions of the big winners from the 21st century economy, the trillion dollar tech companies.** \n\nOkay, but you got to admit that pushing the idea in this way is a bit shitty right?\n\nWhile a VAT tax might sound novel to most Americans, I've worked for European companies, and in my experience the VAT is only really  important on the final transaction, all the vat calculations at the various points along the chain are only made so that they can be passed along and paid as a tax by the end consumer. None of the companies that have 'added value' to a product along the way actually gets taxed on it. Not only that but if the business owner eats a sandwich or takes a luxury jet to work, unlike you or I who have to pay vat on the food we need to keep us alive while we're at work or pay for our own transport to work, they can pass that tax onto you and I as well.\n\nNot only that but there's the obvious problem that in each and every one of those 160 countries it's generally criticised for being a regressive tax. But Yang doesn't mention any of that and sells it as another magic bullet. He doesn't say that his flat tax would be effectively a great burden on the poorest while not mattering at all to the super rich he  doesn't want to tax.  Price of a loaf of bread going up 10% percent really affects me, Bezos isn't going to notice at all. Even if he's buying $10 bread, it's not going to force him to take out another loan against his equity. \n\nHe makes it sound like we're going to be taxing these big companies, when really it's another tax on consumers. \n\nI can understand why people can support a vat tax that's not the big(only) issue for me here,.\n\nBut we've spent the last few years hearing the same bullshit from Trump. Yang may as well call it a Value Added Tariff, he's no less likely to convince people that it isn't just another tax on consumers.  \n\nIf Amazon should be paying more tax, then fucking make them pay more tax, don't tax me more and make it sound like you're doing me a favor.\n\nWe need a President capable of standing up to big corporations not another one trying to be their friend.\n\nAnd it's like the same stuff with how he deflects away from how UBI can cause inflation in rental costs. \n\nExcept this time it's blatant bullshit. Of course prices are going to go up,  Yang's going to make me pay 10% more for a loaf of bread.   \n\n\nIf he came straight out and said, \n\n\"I'm against Bernie's idea that the wealthy should be taxed more. Instead we should have a Freedom Tax that hurts the people on the lowest incomes the most\"\n\nthen, i don't know, I wouldn't support him still, but he wouldn't piss me off so much you know?",

    "text":"Comment response: Well heres the thing. We still need human labor, so the key to basic income is to make it basic. I think in the long term expanding it to a high level would be beneficial, but in the mean time, we need to balance the right to say no, with the needs of society. That being said, most UBI plans are near poverty level or minimum wage. This is not because we wouldnt like to give more (altho some conservatives certainly wouldn't), but it's because we have to balance our ideals with reality. We need to be pragmatic here. So I think a basic UBI plan of around $12k with $4k for children would be best. Again, it can be expanded in the future if it turns out technology changes our entire outlook on labor, but that's what we can do now. \n\nIdeally, I'd like universal healthcare too, but at the very least, I'd settle for the current obamacare solution if we need to deal with it. The thing about universal healthcare is it is very expensive upfront. Most savings are long term, and the initial costs could throw off a UBI projection a lot, leading to higher taxes or lots of debt.\n\nMain message: UBI would be a transformative force for our society. People would be free to do things that they themselves deem productive or worthy of doing rather than being forced to do things that generate a profit for someone (else usually) in order to survive. This has all kinds of effects that we may not be able to predict, but ultimately I think it would be a positive transformation. There will be work that disappears because people don't find it valuable enough to keep in existence by paying enough to cover the cost of keeping an employee at the cost required over and above UBI. How important is Taco Bell to our society really?\n\nI'm pragmatic though, so I don't see being a radical about it being very productive in the short term.\n\nIt needs to be hashed out better. There are a lot of unambitious proposals, but I've yet to see one that would lead to a truly \"free from having to work\" scenario. Although as pointed out in discussion of some of those, being less dependent on a job is still less dependent. I'd like to see something that taxes business based on their savings from being able to offer a similar return for people's work at a lower cost, a per employee tax based on the payment amount with a multiplier to cover the non-working. Combined with a reduced minimum wage, and social security\/welfare elimination, it might work out. Of course there are issues with a per employee tax, but again this is coupled with the question of how valuable is a job really to our society if a business won't pay what is required for it to get done?\n\nUniversal healthcare is a required prerequisite. Obamacare is helpful, single payer would be better, nationalizing the healthcare system would be better still.",

    "text":"Comment response: I mentioned jobs earlier just to expand a bit on why its important now... but the second half of my response is all about how I agree with you that college should ideally be a place for young adults to get together and discuss ideas or learn more about their non-job related interests.... if not for jobs.\n\nBut if you take jobs out of the equation.... its still very expensive to go to college. You would have to take tuition out of that equation also for college to go back to its original intent. Tuition would have to be free or very cheap. \n\nIf your point was that the shift in thinking should go beyond just universal healthcare and basic income to include education then I agree with you. I think these 3 points are very important... well atleast universal healthcare and the rising cost of college\/student loan debt were both important points that I feel should be addressed even now and was paying attention to during the election... but with AI\/automation being a threat to the future then univ. basic income is added onto that list. \n\nMain message: &gt; We are only entrenched in that line of thinking\n\nYeah, and the point of the OP and the discussion is that regardless of the reasons WHY we think the way we do, if we don't change and plan for the future it will be to our own detriment. \n\nSo when I propose a possible solution or shift in value system for when there are no jobs, and you say, \"but jobs.\" Like, we have nothing more to talk about. I am aware of all the things you mention above.\n\n&gt;then why go to college at all?\n\nFor it's original intended purpose?? To exercise thought processes to meet peers and mentors? To learn? Jfc. And, yes, like you said - to socialize and play. Universities have been historically distinct from trade schools for a reason. Finding a career or work skills has been a relatively recently expectation out of the institution.\n\nWhy am I having to have this conversation in r\/futurology of all places?",

    "text":"Comment response: Trickle down economics is any form of economics where money first goes to the rich and the corporations who hire people and pay them in order to spend the money and start moving it around to multiply it. All forms of tax benefits including the stimulus program that Obama approved and the fed's QE are meant to work in this way. The only thing that *isn't* truly trickle down economics is something like UBI where people at the bottom directly get the money and increase the multiplier effect there.\n\n&gt; When we had strong unions in America, we had a strong middle class and great job creation.\n\nThe stagnation of this is definitely cause by money accumulating at the top and creating a lot of inequality, but that isn't because of tax breaks. In fact, Reagan's tax breaks drove the economy even further up because corporations spent it on hiring.\n\n&gt; but will slash taxes on the top and on corporations. That will rapidly accelerate the debt.\n\nI cannot imagine any scenario where cutting taxes will accelerate debt. There is no demand so at all in the first place. So companies will keep accumulating debt to do buybacks and other forms of expenditure that increase shareholder value without actually increasing productivity or multiplying the money. The tax cut will not affect that in any sense. In fact, it will pull in wealth from abroad that could potentially be used to create demand but won't be because corporations would again, spend it on buybacks and shit like that.\n\n&gt; He talks about building a wall , pouring money into the military and the infrastructure. Doing that while slashing taxes will increase the debt rapidly. The GAO says it would increase it hugely.\n\nIf he actually builds the wall, it will be another form of fiscal expenditure that will create jobs. It'll be a tragedy that stops free movement of people but economically, it will work. I don't know the expenses of such a project so high chance he'll put the government deeper into the red than it already is, but hey, the market only cares what the interest rate is. So hold the fed at 0.25% and you'll be golden \/s .. I don't know what the GAO is (not american) but they are right in the sense of it'll increase debt. They are wrong if they say that won't help the economy later. He is the catalyst for the coming crash if he wins. Hillary will simply maintain status quo and make it worse so that in 4 years, there will be another more blatantly racist, nationalist, populist contender who will channel the people's anger.\n\nYou need to understand your economics better. Both candidates talk about creating jobs but there is one major difference - Trump wants to do it by forcing everyone to manufacture inland. This will create a massive number of jobs for unskilled people. It is what will help the economy. It will create a massive recession that the fed will have to hold through with low interest rates and start increasing it later, but that will at least cleanse the damn place.\n\nMain message:   Trickle down economics is cutting taxes for those on top and corporations.  The idea is that with all that money , they will create jobs. It is fundamentally bad economics. The driver for job creation is demand. Demand is increased a lot more by the poor and middle class who will spend the money . \n\n  When we had strong unions in America, we had a strong middle class and great job creation. Corporations are at all time high profits, but they are not into profit sharing. Worker salaries have stagnated .  The money actually trickles up to the top.\n\n  Trump has no real policies on the economy, but will slash taxes on the top and on corporations. That will rapidly accelerate the debt. He talks about building a  wall , pouring money into the military and the infrastructure. Doing that while slashing taxes will increase the debt rapidly. The GAO says it would increase it hugely.\n\n  Trump is way out of his field in politics. He proves it every time he opens his food hole.",

Giving money out to the poor having taken it primarily from the rich and corporations through a VAT on non-staple goods doesn\u2019t affect the the money supply at all. If we were paying for a UBI by just printing money (or more realistically lowering interest rates to increase the overall money supply), that might cause commensurate increases in housing prices.\n\nFor an inkling of how misguided this whole \u2018landlord will raise rent $1000\u2019 meme that has been cycling around leftist online spaces, think about Medicare for All. If M4A is passed, the working poor will have to spend a smaller percentage of their income on healthcare. Based on the logic used above, this extra money would go directly to these imaginary price-setting landlords who can charge whatever they like and not worry about being undercut by competition.\n\nYou\u2019re right insofar as markets don\u2019t care about the needs of actual human beings right now, but what Yang wants to do is create an economy where positive externalities are encouraged and negative ones are penalised through taxation. If we can achieve that end (Yang calls it \u201cHuman-centered capitalism) we are likely to get better outcomes for lower prices than if the government were to set prices. Fundamentally, I care a lot more about outcomes than about achieving them in a way that feels more moral to me.\n\nThe one main way I would go further than Yang in my ideal scenario would be to offer guaranteed basic housing\u2014homelessness in this country should be totally eliminated, and it would cost barely anything when you consider what we spend on problems related to homelessness right now. Generally, I (like Yang) am for raising the floor of wellbeing in any given sector rather than messing with the entire market.\n\nMain message: Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want UBI, but it shouldn\u2019t be financed by a regressive VAT tax, it should be another form of redistribution from those who have to those who have not.\n\nThe problem with UBI in the form that Libertarians\/Liberals want, is that they don\u2019t want to control prices, so the only thing they are doing is to increase inflation (because suddenly much more people can afford stuff that they previously couldn\u2019t) this isn\u2019t the fault of UBI per se, but more of the fault of markets in general, because markets fucking suck ass.\n\nMarkets allocate resources to those who can afford it not to those who need it the most, that\u2019s why they suck, in order for them to work \u201cgood enough\u201d they need to be heavily regulated, UBI falls in a category of regulations.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a car that breaks down every 3 months or so, you repair it the best you can every time that happens, would you blame the \u201cfixes\u201d for you car not working? Obviously not, if you wanted to transport more efficiently you would by a new car.\n\nThat\u2019s how I see markets.",

Elimination of jobs because of increased costs. Literally the same.\n\nLiterally a UBI is circumventing the traditional trickle down economics. While 15 dollar minimum wage is truly a band aid and makes a person still a wage slave dependent on their corporate overlords.\n\nElimination of college debt? Do you know the percentage of people in this country that go to college or even graduate? UBI would address all of this.\n\nThen you have a guaranteed job in what it has still yet to be determined, that \"may\" pay you better is pretty speculative. \n\nIt's fascinating to me that people can't see that instead of shifting the trickle down mechanics, they are shifting it from the corporations to the biggest corporation of all, the government.\n\nMain message: Well first of all, Yang argued with Bernie. Bernie was just answering  a question asked during an interview. First off let's talk about the pitfalls of Yang's vision for UBI and how that would impact us. Yang wants to implement UBI but isn't a heavy believer in governmental regulation so what's a possibility with Yang's UBI? Salary decreases, rent raised, and benefits slashed because the people in charge are taking into account that you're opting into this program. This also accounts for a secondary issue with UBI, it's an opt in program where you have to opt out of others (one of the most stunning being WIC). Yang has mentioned in interviews before that a goal of his is to make people dependent on opting into UBI and phasing out these programs altogether. This is an issue because it doesn't get at the root of systemic issues to begin with and eliminates federal assistance in exchange for cash. While we do deserve better programs than what we have currently, that's why Bernie is putting forward many universal programs rather than the mean tested ones we have currently. For example, welfare is not very popular while Medicare and Social Security are. Basically, there is no real guarantee that UBI will benefit Americans all that much in the long run and without any sort of regulation or accountability from the capitalist class it will cause people to stay just as poor as they were the month before.\n\nNow let's talk about how Bernie can help you. Yang doesn't really believe in setting minimum wage at $15.00. I've heard a lot of complaints from Yang Gang because they talk about average cost of living but it belies the point that making minimum wage $15.00 will make salaries in general go up because of competition and in all likelihood your salary will go up too. With the elimination of college debt and the availability of free college if you no longer have debt you will be able to spend more money, and it will serve as an enormous economic stimulus package as well. This will increase the overall standard of living in the United States. With Sanders guaranteed jobs if you CHOOSE to do so, you can get a good paying job that will help rebuild American society that may in fact pay better than what you currently have. With Bernie's green new deal a great deal of governmental and war waste will be redirected into saving our planet. And with Medicare for All you will save money that you would have otherwise spent on copays and insurance. There's a lot more but this is only the surface and Bernie is still releasing proposals.\n\nBasically the choice is between a band-aid, or the fundamental restructuring of American society in a way that benefits all of us. Under Bernie, you will absolutely be in much better sorts.",

My freedom will consist in that protected and empowered status.\n&gt; \n&gt; ...\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose there are just a few employers and many available employees, and that times are hard. In those conditions I and those who like me will not be able to command a decent wage: a wage that will enable us to function properly in society.

Other protections, such as those that strong trade unions might provide, are possible against such alien\n&gt; control.

A number of considerations might argue for this provision. A universal right of the sort imagined would resist electoral pressure for change better than would a needs-tested right, since it would benefit everyone in common, thus being a more entrenched and firmer bulwark against domination. A universal right would mean that those who rely on the basic income \u2013 distinct from the independently wealthy \u2013 will not have to assert their right on the grounds of being a class apart: people who depend on others\u2019 goodwill and are easier targets of control and domination. And a universal right symbolizes the fundamental equality of all in relation to the collective provisions of government; only some will depend on the basic income that all receive, but all can see that the income is there to depend on, should they themselves fall on hard times.\n\nMain message: \"A Republican Right to Basic Income?\" by Philip Pettit of Princeton University [pdf]",

I\u2019m afraid they may be tempted to justify an increase in prices knowing that people can afford it. And then as the value of the dollar decreases, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019d be right back where we started. \n\nBut then again, as people are spending that UBI, they\u2019re stimulating the economy which could have numerous benefits, and not cause inflation. \nSo I guess I really don\u2019t know what would happen until it (if ever) happens.\n\nMain message: It's a good idea in the sense that everyone needs money to live, even if they end up in a situation where they're unemployed\/unemployable (see: ex-cons, disabled or mentally ill people who aren't a good fit for any or most jobs) or ineligible for government benefits (e.g. people who've been fired from their jobs, don't qualify for unemployment, and haven't found or can't find a new job that's suited to their needs).\n\nThe two main drawbacks are:\n\n* People might rely on UBI payments too much as a crutch (most obvious argument against)\n* It would be used as a justification by policymakers to cut spending on other services involving a payout (disability, unemployment, etc.) under the assumption that all that covers is streamlined into UBI",

Studies show that when poor people get extra money, the vast majority of them put it to good use. It's actually richer people who put it towards practices like alcohol. The \"poor people are lazy and spend their time doing drugs\" is just a stereotype.\n\n\nSource: [Kurzgesagt's video on UBI](https:\/\/youtu.be\/kl39KHS07Xc) (a good watch if you want an overview on UBI. It's not specific to Yang, and was released in 2017)\n\nMain message: So in regards to his healthcare plan, I feel like he's treating secondary symptoms that are a result of a systemic issue. He addresses drug prices, accessibility, etc., but I didn't see much in regards to insurance companies and for profit practices of 'non profit' hospitals benefiting at the expense of the patient, which is a major issue in my area. I work in the Emergency Room, so I see the worst of the worst come in, I see people exploit the system, and I get it, but I don't think it should have to be that way. Maybe reducing lobbyist power will help with insurance running healthcare, or at least be a start, but if there's a concrete answer, that'd be great. I like everything else he's saying pertaining to healthcare though.\n\nUniversal income sounds like it'll be an interesting experiment. Are there going to be any regulations in place to keep renter's from doubling prices now that everyone is $1000 richer, is minimum wage going to be impacted, are the safeties in place to prevent people from just going wild and being homeless but now with $1000 to spend on booze\/drugs, or is it going to be a none of our business kind of deal. $1000 does a lot, that's about how much I got from my GI Bill monthly and it made sure I didn't have to break my back working while going through school, so I'm all for it. I'm just concerned about the consequences. \n\nInexperience isn't an issue for me. Being an experienced politician doesn't mean shit about how you'll run the country, and if he's already backing experts and data, I'm all for it. \n\nMy biggest concerns are of course healthcare, the geopolitics and our actual respect as a country (not just being a bully or police force), and the environment. I want everyone to be able to have access to healthcare without the hospital footing the bill, creating issues like shitty patient ratios for me because they won't hire enough nurses. I want hospitals who operate like this to be punished in a way that doesn't affect the employees and patients, like taking away funding. I think at this point in humanity, the leaders of the world really need to set a precedent, start working together, and thinking ahead. Not just because of the environment, but eventually, we need to think bigger. Space exploration and colonization should be a multidisciplinary, multinational project because it pertains to humans as whole. It shouldn't be privatized, it shouldn't be run by one country. It is daunting task, and we should pull from every resource we have. This doesn't mean we should abandon hope with what we have though, and I think environmental safety and regulations are just as important. I've always expected to have children, but as of recent, I'm hesitant based on what's going on around me. I don't want them having to grow up in some *Interstellar* scenario, you know?\n\nI just got off shift so I'm trying to gather my thoughts, this thread blew up a lot more than I had expected and I'm grateful, it's been very informative.",

I had to fill in stacks and stacks of forms. I had to spend hours on declaring the few bucks I had made as a freelancer. \n\nI didn't mind eating ramen, I didn't mind being poor. But I hated the worries and constant pressure and fear.\n\nThat whole system held me back from reintegration into the labor market.\n\nWe already have a \"basic income\", In my country there's welfare, disability, pensions, child support, etc. \n\nSimplifying those would save a lot of money, and decrease a lot of the pressure on those who want to grow and do more with their life than being a couch potato.\n\nThe couch potatoes will find a way to be couch potatoes regardless of the system.\n\nYou could think: \"But they don't deserve it!\", and maybe you're right. \n\nBut a couch potato without a couch tends to become a street potato with a knife.\n\nMain message: Do you think people will self improve if they get free money? Did you take a look at welfare people in the present? The absolute majority rots in front of a TV drinking and wasting their lives as they have no motivation to do hard things. \nThe necessity drives our desire to do things. Remove that and 90% will just look for short term pleasure.",

So you need to look at it from a value\/trade-off angle. What are you getting from UBI in terms of value and at what price. I would say its worth it for the price and how we are paying for it.

    "text":"Comment response: &gt;Hmm...I would agree with a 10k\/yr basic income, and I've always heard that it would cost ~2 trillion\/yr*\n\n~$2 trillion is within 10% of the math I have for $10k\/year basic income.  But you still need a way to raise $2 trillion a year in taxes.  Eliminate the mortgage interest deduction, remove SNAP\/TANF (money goes to Basic Income), remove charity deductions and remove unemployment and you are still $1.5 trillions short.  You can cut the amount Social Security pays by the amount Basic Income pays (if SS paid $20k before, people still get $20k, half comes from Basic Income, half SS, and Social Security folds that money into Basic Income), but you will only gain ~$150 billion or so. \n\nAt that point, you come to hard economic choices, and pretty much all of them have terrible consequences.   By removing the mortgage interest deduction alone, you murdered the housing market for 5-10 years as that sorts out.  Tax increases on high income workers will make them leave (seriously, as the taxes required for this aren't the boiling the frog slowly but rather a rapid boil).  And as businesses become more global, it kills the incentive to be headquartered in the US, if all you get for that is higher taxes.   \n\n\n\nMain message: Hmm...I would agree with a 10k\/yr basic income, and I've always heard that it would cost ~2 trillion\/yr*(I'll check to make sure, but I'm pretty sure that I read that somewhere). I think removing\/downsizing certain government programs like foodstamps and SS would save more money than just the sticker cost. Government bureaucracy tends to spend much more money than necessary. \n",

I work and publish in a number of area of ethics, including ethical theory, moral psychology, practical ethics, and the history of moral philosophy. Much (though not all) of my work has a Kantian flavor \u2013 but do note I\u2019m willing to take Kant and Kantians to task when need be! (For a good overview of my work on Kant\u2019s ethics, check out my book *Understanding Kant\u2019s Ethics*).\n\nHere are some more specifics about my research:\n\n* I\u2019m perhaps best known for my work on philosophy of death and dying, including my work on [suicide](https:\/\/plato.stanford.edu\/entries\/suicide\/) and grief. With respect to suicide, my views are complicated: I argue that most acts of suicide violate our Kantian duty to preserve our rational agency, but precisely because this is a self-regarding duty or duty to self, then at a social level, individuals have an autonomy-based right to shorten their lives, consistent with their moral obligations to others; that medically assisted dying is not contrary to the moral norms of medicine and that the medical profession should not monopolize access to desirable ways of shortening our lives; that, all other things being equal, mental health problems provide equally strong justifications for suicide as do \u2018physical\u2019 ailments, etc.; and that non-invasive public health measures to prevent suicide are typically defensible. \n\n* Grief is an understudied phenomenon among philosophers. Much of my work here is concerned with understanding how grief can makes our lives better \u2014 why we wouldn\u2019t find it desirable to be unable to grieve, [like Meursault in Camus\u2019 *The Stranger*](http:\/\/www.fourbythreemagazine.com\/issue\/death\/the-stranger-the-saint-and-griefs-goodness) \u2014 despite the fact that it involves pain or mental distress. [In the book I\u2019m writing](https:\/\/www.academia.edu\/31062180\/No_Delight_But_in_Tears_A_Philosophical_Examination_of_Grief_introduction_), I propose that grief represents an especially fruitful opportunity to know ourselves and understand our own commitments and values more deeply. \n\n* In other areas of social ethics, I write on paternalism, defending what I call the ['rational will' conception](https:\/\/philpapers.org\/rec\/CHOPAO) of paternalism, [wherein paternalism is wrong because it intercedes in our powers of rational agency in various ways](http:\/\/blogs.lse.ac.uk\/theforum\/identity-threat\/); on race and criminal justice, where I argue ([in a forthcoming paper in *Ethics*](https:\/\/philpapers.org\/archive\/CHOBLM.pdf)) that racial bias in the administration of the death penalty in the U.S. merits its de facto abolition; and on the philosophy of work and labor, a new area of research where I\u2019m exploring universal basic income and notions of meaningful work.\n\nAs you can tell, my work is very diverse, both topically and methodologically. I try to integrate empirical work from economics, legal studies, and psychiatry into my research where appropriate. \n\nI look forward to discussing any and all of my work with the reddit audience!\n\n(My proof has been given to the mods of \/r\/philosophy)\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nIamAbot_v01.

Then implement public-option healthcare, housing, and education at reasonable rates. \n\nThe beauty of a basic income benefit is that you no longer have to assess whether someone is disabled, old, poor, or unlucky enough to get benefits, because everyone does. You also don't have the scenario where people lose economic standing going back to work because they no longer qualify for welfare. \n\nThere would be abuse-- people living off the dole and not contributing to society-- but this would be coming from the 20% who hardly produce anything anyway. \n\nMain message: Social benefits.

I assume you also care more about pragmatism than some hoighty-toighty idealistic nonsense, therefore you'll agree it's time to try a new strategy. Let's analyze this economic problem.\n\nThe way unemployment benefits work now is: someone receives $15\/hr from UB, a small business owner offers wages of $16\/hr, whoever takes the job will lose the $15\/hr income, effectively making it so the American salt-of-the-earth worker would only be making $1\/hr. Because you're a strong independent conservative who don't need no state I assume you have a thorough understanding of economics, especially something as fundamental as the law of supply and demand. An additional $1\/hr won't generate very much demand for other economic actors to sell their time. Unfortunately, the data show most small businesses fail in the first 5 years, so we know for a fact most business owners are incompetent. This whole problem started in the first place because they can't afford to increase their wages to a point that they attract employees.\n\nHm I dunno... how 'bout giving citizens federal unemployment benefits... except we don't make them conditional on employment? We could even reduce the amount to cut costs, to the point it only provides the basic necessities. Almost like an... unconditional... basic... income. Sound good? Let's call this project the Unemployment Benefits Initiative and use the initialism UBI going forward.\n\nMain message: 26 states ended federal unemployment benefits early.

    "text":"Comment response: We can buy MOP with enough UBI. Think about it. If everyone gets for example a $24,000 USD check every year, like what US politician and proletariat? Ilhan Omar advocated for, that would be enough to buy a high quality industrial 3D printer like the kind now being developed to make car parts. If 50 people got together and pooled their checks that would be $1.2million which is easily enough to start a decent worker co-op with a fair amount of capital intensity. \n\nSure capital intensive worker co-ops could still exploit labor intensive worker co-ops, but it would be hard to exploit the workers who controlled over $1.2 million in capital machinery. And imagine if you could get 500 workers together that would be $12 million. And remember, these checks would be distributed annually. That means every year that group of 50 workers could add another $1.2million USD in capital to their business. After 10-20 years that would really add up, capital would be much more evenly distributed throughout the economy. Probably by then everyone would own or co-own their own business and wage labor would be obsolete.\n\nBut what if the bourgeoisie caught on to what was going on and all met together in some smoke filled room to conspire as a united class to not sell any capital goods and to raise prices on consumer goods? Then the UBI could just be funded by property taxes on capital goods. The property taxes would be increased to unplayable levels forcing buiness owners to sell their businesses just to pay their taxes. Their tax debt could only be paid for if they sold the businesses to their workers. The worker co-op tax rate would remain the same at first.\n\n\"But that sounds like reform not revolution! You can't change the base through a change in the superstructure!\"  \n\nThat's a misunderstanding of dialectical materialism. Marx and Engels said the base is the determining factor in conflict with the superstructure, not that it is impossible for the superstructure to change the base. After all the DOTP proposed by Marx is a superstructure that would work to fundamentally alter the base of society through nationalizing industry, providing labor vouchers, etc. Marx did not mean that the superstructure couldn't change the base. \n\nThere have been many historical examples of this happening. Feudalism transformed into mercantilism and capitalism not just through revolution but also through the advancement of lower aristocracy and the expansion of democratic structures already present to very small degrees in feudalism. The planned economy socialist experiments of the 20th century became mixed and market economies in nearly all cases through reform and gradual superstructure changes. \n\n\"But what about what Engels said in Anti-Duhring about the value form leading always ultimately to imperialism and capitalist economic crisis!\" Sure it might if left unchecked by mixed economy features. That's why even with worker co-ops there would need to be capital taxation to prevent capital intensive worker co-ops from exploiting labor intensive worker co-ops.\n\n\"But what about Marx's arguments in Critique of the Gotha Program criticizing social democracy and Bernstein's reform to socialism ideas!\" Yeah but these ideas are a little more modern than Bernstein and aren't necessarily anti-revolution. In fact UBI could empower workers in fighting a revolution and an increased presence of worker co-ops prior to the revolution would mean the economic transition post-revolution would be less jarring. The last 105 years have shown jarrring economic transformations are not a good idea. \n\n\"But what about post-scarcity anarchism-communism!\" Sorry, the material conditions have not been developed enough for that to be possible yet. We need to work on devloping productive forces through market economics    because planned economies have been proven to be less adapt at solving the economic calculation problem and local knowledge problems. As for the immediate abolition of all hierarchies and the commidity form good luck with that.\n\nUBI isn't just about making the capitalist death pangs more bearable, if done right it can actually enable worker control of the means of production and a future world of more positive freedom for everyone. There are economic objections to it I haven't countered here but can if asked.\n\nMain message: What is your position on UBI",

As of this writing, we estimate that over 80% of FD is paid for through itself and in combination with other Yang proposals.

They were just raised differently and I think there\u2019s something to be learned there about how we view ourselves. There\u2019s an old episode of Star Trek where Abraham Lincoln calls Uhura a \u201cLovely N word\u201d then he immediately apologizes because he realized that in the future you\u2019re not allowed to say that. However, Uhura responds with \u201cDon\u2019t worry, in the future we\u2019re all taught to love ourselves and aren\u2019t worried about words.\u201d\n\n#***5***\n\nMe: \u201cIf we raised are children to not be bothered by words then we could grow as a species.\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cThat's not how humans work at all. Words have power and to argue they cannot hurt anyone is arguing that words mean nothing. If a word cannot hurt anyone then it also cannot give anyone pleasure. What you want would required the erasure of emotions and turning everyone into a robot.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not advocating for words to mean nothing. I\u2019m advocating to ignore words that invoke negative reactions. If some racist hillbilly calls you the N word I\u2019m not saying you should be friends with him. Just form a mindset where you can say to yourself \u201cWell that individual is obviously unhappy and uneducated\u201d then move on with your day without carrying that negativity. \n\n#***6***\n\nMe: \u201cThe second reason is that you\u2019re forgetting that not everyone getting bullied is totally innocent\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cWow what the fuck is wrong with you? \"They deserved to get bullied\" is really what you want to use as an argument to defend freedom of speech?\u201d\n\nAgain, I didn\u2019t articulate this as well as I should have. I was trying to say that there are people who lie about being bullied. Same as there are women who lie about being sexually assaulted. They might not all have the same motivations but people are sick and they\u2019ll abuse any system they can if it gets them what they want. A good recent example of this is what\u2019s happening to Johnny Depp at the moment.\n\n#***7***\n\nMe: \u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself a progressive\n\nThe left is always front and center ready to accuse everyone else of being fascist but they seem to be completely blind to their own brand of fascism.\u201d\n\nYou impersonating me: \"The Left used a word that hurt my feelings so I changed all of my opinions about the economy, social issues, systemic racism, health care, and history.\"\n\n\u201c'Words literally don\u2019t hurt people' my ass.\u201d\n\nMe: This is a pretty savage straw man argument. I still absolutely believe that healthcare is a right in a modern society and I think America is in desperate need of universal basic income. I\u2019m in a really frustrating pickle at the moment because I see Republicans as fascist warmongers, democrats as corporate warmongers, and now progressive are trying hard to shift into a quasi communist group instead of the social democratic group that I want them to be.\n\nMain message: Yes, I want to argue my point. Same as you. \n\nBut if you don't want to defend yourself then you are free to make that choice.",

Also, what one has to pay in LVT is offset by excess taxes redistributed as a Citizens Dividend, or call it UBI if you like.  Essentially if the land you pay taxes on (imagine multiunit buildings, LVT is split amongst the residents) has a value that is lower than the average value, less per capita gov spending of the LVT revenue, you will receive more money than what you pay in LVT, others with higher value land would just get a partial refund.  Yes, this also requires efficient use of revenue by the government, but they will be able to more easily fund public works projects, as they will reap the increase in land value due to the projects.  This in turn would encourage denser housing in areas improved by those projects, allowing more people to benefit from them and also spread out the increased LVT amounts.  Denser housing will supply more homes, lowering their price, and also reduce urban sprawl which in turn lowers personal vehicle use\/emissions spent on long commutes, which encourages building of public transit.  I know I went further than the question asked, but I wanted to demonstrate the public works\/LVT feedback loop as it's important to show there is also quality of life benefits to this, not just income\/tax benefits.\n\ntypo: find &gt; fund\n\nMain message: Making rent-profiteering unprofitable is a major goal, I agree.

UBI will cause a dramatic shift in the market like we've never seen. Inflation just won't be a factor. It'll exist in an abstract way, at best. In actuality, the housing market and the every other part of life will develop a \"baseline\" price and that price will be completely inflexible so long as UBI remains inflexible (which it should). That's just how the realities of a UBI majority economy would work. \n\nMain message: The flaw there is that this assumption is that there is nobody with more money than UBI. Someone with a job could easily afford something just slightly out of the range of the standard UBI. You'd also still get variance across UBI where the max is how much you could charge and the person still has money for food\/gas\/etc but no non-essentials. Some people might be willing to take such a rent if it meant living in a better area.\n\nInflation also has multiple sources that are not related to those factors, so I dont think you can state with any certainty that a UBI would remove inflation. It might reduce it, but it would still exist.",

    "text":"Comment response: Here is a different opinion for you. America is the richest country in the history of the planet and we absolutely could guarantee a basic level of outcome to every single citizen. \n\nHere is my reasoning. Equality of opportunity is impossible; the poor inner city kid or poor rural kid will NOT have the same opportunities as the child of a movie star or oil baron. There is no way to equalize the amount of opportunity gained from access to private schools, tutors, better nutrition etc. between the oil baron's kid and the poor rural kid. \n\nThe better solution then, in my opinion, is to try and guarantee a basic level of outcome for all citizens. Being an American should guarantee access to schooling, healthcare, police protection, equal protection under the law, housing, food, etc. Basically America is rich enough to guarantee everyone access to those things. \n\nThe solution for this is to provide a Universal Basic Income to all American's that would guarantee they could access the bare necessaries. This would of course require building MUCH more public housing and removing as many \"rent seeking\" landlords extracting wealth from the country without providing any value as well as many other reforms. \n\nWill some people abuse the system? Sure, just like they do now. But in my opinion this guarantees the most number of American's a good and decent life.\n\nMain message: I wish that this opinion was more unpopular.\n\nBasically, you are saying that it OK for people to be parasite if they don't ***feel like*** working.

Why are drugs expensive? Obviously we're talking about illegal drugs which are made illegal through government social engineering programs. In fact, most illegal drugs are very, very, very cheap to make. Marijuana can easily be grown by anyone if they're not afraid of being caught for the fact that it is illegal. Otherwise it's not hard to grow at all. LSD is so cheap to manufacture that it is one of the main reasons it was banned. It's simply too cheap to allow especially when users tend to lose interest in keeping up with the Joneses. Psilocybin literally grows out of wood chips without even the need for lighting. \n\nMany currently illegal recreational drugs could be available at next to no cost if they were not illegal. So what if there no longer was the possibility of spending all the money on illegal recreational drugs because those drugs no longer cost enough to allow someone to blow their money on them? \n\nSo now what, they are going to \"fuck like rabbits\". Is that really a problem that other people should be concerned with? I'm surprised we aren't hearing that they would all turn gay. Hmm, seem to be an interesting set of arguments with an oddly familiar theme. Almost like something you'd hear in a church. ",

    "text":"Comment response:  I agree. People can't protect their own property so we do need government intervention for that.\n\nI agree many people have incentive to work for other people, but I still think it's self-interested if only for psychological reasons and not monetarily. Even so, I would prefer that these people do get compensated for their \"hobbies\" so that they can continue to educate themselves in what they love to do and be rewarded for the time they spent. Art is valuable, information is valuable whether or not people slap a dollar per hour price on it. Without art we would have no culture or real experience. It's pathetic how the U.S generally devalues anything involving exercising the right hemisphere of the brain to focus on a left-hemisphere oriented work force that can't appreciate the abstract, emotional, and holistic side of reality.\n\nWhile I don't agree with white supremacy obviously and am an active combatant of it there is is a valid point. I'm a product of multiculturalism so I will support and defend it by any means. However I understand the challenges involved in handling a representative government that speaks on behalf of all cultures and races. It's not impossible but it is difficult, especially in America where we are experiencing a bipartisan fracture. We have a history if racial tension and blacks being underrepresented and forced into poverty stricken and neglected urban districts. You have to take into account the history of Big Govt. decades long false promises of making the economy more accessible to all races, while simultaneously slashing public school funding, overperscription of pharmaceuticals, as well as the \"War on Drugs\" and increased private prison funding to incarcerate nonviolent drug offenders. We have not seen any substantial progress when it comes to combatting racism if anything we've just created a climate where speaking about such controversial topics gets you removed from the conversation. But look at the Cannabis industry. It's still federally illegal, it's booming in select states with lower minority populations, and most of the non violent offenders are still serving prison time while white business owners are no reaping the profits. I'm not trying to make this into a race issue, because it's bigger than race, it's Classism, but unfortunately due to bias on a world scale beyond America, it does play a large factor. But I will never blame diversity ever. I will blame racism and supremacist ideology as a barrier. That requires education and reprogramming to counter the institutionalized indoctrination and the cultural\/racial bias that comes with it.\n\nI'm not saying Democratic Socialism would be impossible in America and I'm willing to support it, under the pretense that historically in America minorities have continuously been lied to, since the 1970's. I'm not even going to go into the details of how immigration has affected American black industry because it's a sensitive topic. But I don't agree with outsourcing labor to immigrants when we have a homegrown workforce that still struggles to get business loans, find access to adequate trade schooling, and has difficulty finding post grad work due to racial bias that can't always be proven in a court of law.\n\nAs for the labor paying for the bosses yacht, well working for someone is a matter of consent. I would personally rather be my own boss working in the service economy than working for another person's vision. Others who disagree may find the experience worth their time until they can network or otherwise finance a startup. They may not and they can quit and work for a different employer who doesn't buy yachts lol.\n\nThere's no getting around the fact that if I work under someone they see the majority of my labor, but I signed my name and set a mutually agreed upon price on my labor by doing so. I never consented to the govt. taking my earnings unless you mean to say that just by being employed to provide for myself that's consent enough. You may be right, but I still disagree with it. \n\nI definitely agree with workplace democracy and wage sharing. I believe in strikes and protection from workplace retalition. I'm very Pro Union.\n\nI guess without Capitalism the only way I could see us headed towards a sustainable economy in the A.I age is UBI or a Social Credit System. That's not my decision to make, it's up to what the people want. I would very strongly encourage decentralizing govt. powers if we collectively give them the authority to issue allowance especially when it's coming from our taxes. I just want to avoid another government shutdown because suddenly a boarder wall became a National Emergency. Centralized government has too much executive power in my opinion and they are too easily swayed by lobbyist groups who care about profit and not at all about sustainability.\n\nMain message: &gt; keeps government largely out of the private sector,\n\nThe government enforces property laws. Without the government there is no private sector.\n\n&gt; people weren't naturally self-interested\n\nPeople are inherently social creatures. People contribute to Wikipedia, make huge Minecraft nonsense, release free art, contribute to open source, etc etc, despite living under a system which will literally kill you (via starvation and exposure) if you do not find a way to use your labor for someone else's profit.\n\n&gt; as long as the government demands a percentage of someone else's labor, it positions them to where they can devalue or even dehumanize the working class.\n\nYour boss demands a percentage of your labor. It is quite large.\n\n&gt; I personally have issues with taxation as a concept anyway. I don't think anybody should be forced or otherwise coherced into paying for things they don't want.\n\nYour labor pays for your boss's yacht.\n\n&gt; I agree with Democratic Socialism but I'm not naive. I realize that the areas where it works are largely homogenous and mostly monocultural.\n\nThis is originally a white supremacist talking point. Don't do their job for them by repeating it. Every time you say that a better world is not possible because diversity exists, you are creating a world where it is harder for a better world to exist, and blaming diversity.\n\n&gt;  I'm a believer in less government because I believe that individuals should have the understanding to govern themselves. If we do have to have Government, then I think we should focus on making it more decentralized so that govt. powers can be diffused.\n\nThen you should agree that people need to be able to democratically govern their workplaces. Worker-owned co-operatives are the only business model that is compatible with the ideals you're expressing.",

If I'm not mistaken the intent was to then slowly phase in the upper income brackets until it became properly universal.\n\nI don't necessarily have a problem with that as what it effectively is doing is just sliding up the breakeven threshold for UBI. If you are below the line you receive funds but if you are above it you pay in. Of course it's easier to have everyone get the funds up front and work everything out at tax time but I suspect that even for New York that's a bit too progressive to make politically viable in comparison to a phased transition.\n\nEither way I suspect that this will be how every basic income program rollout will be until the first one makes its way to completion. No organisation is going to be able to make that full jump other than possibly the Federal Government (provided it somehow gets passed) for something that is so \"risky\".\n\nOnce the first large scale implementation can be shown to be successful however I suspect we'll see a lot of regions adopt it.\n\nMain message: Yes, but unless I'm misremembering the details of Yang's proposal, it wasn't actually discriminate, it had a wealth ceiling.",

To avoid exploitation we would have had to do that all differently, which I see as unlikely either way), but capitalism I think compounds the issue. I would say I'm opposed to \"socialism,\" but I still think we need a hefty dose of it (but slowly and democratically and one policy at a time). \n\nTrade can certainly lift countries out of poverty, but it has only hurt the vast majority of them. This is unfortunate because at this point they don't have a choice *but* to trade, and most third world countries can't even form a cohesive identity because they're living so day-to-day that they have no concept of the borders colonies forced on them or a concept of a nation or what it's supposed to do. Those lucky enough to pull themselves together (or have the culture that provides identity) certainly are boosted, the rest are damaged and unable to recover because colonization introduced new culture and erased a lot of identity that may have been building.\n\nI think that eventually, though, technology (and leftist thinking) will gradually pull us towards more socialist policies (such as UBI, but I think that won't occur until we have a little data revolution or something where we're openly acknowledging as a society that data is valuable and powerful, and I don't just mean in the way that people think the internet is cool and important right now. I can talk more about this if you want because I think it's key to where I think humanity is headed and leads into the less-capitalistic future I'm envisioning). This has been humanity's direction since Jericho and I see no reason to presume it would change. \n\n(I would also point out that China has definitely picked up a few capitalist traits regardless of what they call themselves, and I don't give a hoot what the WTO says about them either, it's just one of the three main economic empire institutions made to foster western capitalism and success based on western standards lol)\n\nMain message: Out of interest, what do you make of China's activities in Africa?\n\nIf you weren't aware in the past 15 years, China has invested heavily in Africa essentially providing and building infrastructure like railways, roads and airports in exchange for the rights to the nation's resources.\n\nChina technically is not a capitalist economy. It's dominated by the State and State-owned enterprises and it was just refused \"market economy\" status by the WTO. \n\nDo you think this case indicates that your main criticism of capitalism is present in more socialist economies too? And as such you should be opposed to Socialism in that it would allow poorer countries to be exploited.\n\nNote, the case of China also indicates the tremendous ability of trade to lift countries out of poverty, something you question in a lower post.",

But destroy the middle earners pretty fast too.\n\nMain message: Basic income is a recipe for inflation, so the government would have to continually increase the basic income amount to ensure it was doing what it's supposed to do.  The government could obviously do this, but it would hurt savers immensely and they would pull their savings out of banks and put it in to other things like hard assets (start buying up real estate or precious metals, etc.) offshore accounts, and so on.  This would have a severely negative impact on the economy.\n\nThe government could establish rules and regulations preventing savers from doing this, but then capital would fly out of the country in no time and that would be a disaster.  Not only that, but savings is the primary means by which an economy grows, so even if people accepted basic income and did nothing, their savings would be evaporated away by the inflation it would engender, which would have a negative impact on growth rates.\n\nThere really is no way around it--if you take money away from productive people and give it to unproductive people in exchange for nothing, your economy will suffer.

I honestly don't think of my choosing to go to an establishment as a way for a person to survive, but rather that they survive because they provide a needed and good service (though really a universal basic income so everyone can survive regardless would be ideal and working would be extra), one that I happen to benefit from. I just don't see it as dystopian or tragic as long as everyone treats everyone with respect and appreciation though. \n\n\n\n\nIf it were acceptable and a way I could accurately show my gratitude without having to add to pointless consumerism and waste for flowers and chocolates etc. I think it would be kind of nice. Adjusting the amount is more like having the amount reflect the level of friendship demonstrated.  If I was a guest but they acted annoyed at my presence and were rude a lavish gift would feel awkward, it is a general human tendency to do a type of reciprocity (which is why corporate gifts of even a pen to a medical doctor is a bad idea) in our social relations and hospitality is in a weird in between place of business and social. \n\nSometimes (most of the time), I don't want to engage in a social exchange so I stay home and cook myself. If I'm out though, I expect to engage in social niceties including tipping- but I don't view this as a weird bribe for good service or a generous bestowment to an underling (it seems you think that tipping implies this which you rightly abhor but I don't think that is what tipping is about at all).

Doesn't it to you?\n\nEven with gifts, imagine if the system was that when visiting a friends house, you gave them a gift, every time. But you don't give that gift when you arrive, you withhold it until you leave.  And you adjust the quality of that gift, based on how well you think they hosted you.  Now imagine that your friend depends on that gifts, and other gifts like it, to survive.  Horrific.",

    "text":"Comment response: And see JG isn't a minimum wage regulation. Its a de facto wage floor that says basically, if you can't afford these wages, you might not be able to hire employees. Its widely accepted that lowering wages is counterproductive solution because market price stickiness is a thing for a lot of reasons (conspicuous consumption, pricepoints, menu costs). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat Wray had proposed is that if you start the wage floor where the current minimum wage is and move it up, these firms will be able to afford it because of the increased demand from the deficit spending in those areas. \n\n  \nBut see, rather than doing a UBI where the demand increases are happening everywhere, the demand increases in the places where there is a supply of workers at the buffer stock price. \n\n  \nWage increases for any individual increases their buying power. Period. If there is wage inflation that results in price increases, why do you think that the this increase will result in less buying power? Like mcdonald's increases their wages, will all the prices of electronics go up? Will the price of mcdonald's hamburgers go up? Amazon has a $15 dollar minimum wage, they didn't increase prices to compensate for that. In fact, its competitors (not necessarily for consumer products but for warehouse staff) are going to have to match the wage to retain their workers or seriously reduce their output or streamline their business. But raising the price of their products assumes that their customers will continue to buy their products at the higher price. They might, but they also might not.\n\nLong-story short, cost increases don't always result in price increases for the system as a whole.   \n\n\nWhat we need to worry about is inflation that is accelerating, not singular price increases in a competitive system. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd look, if a firm is doing monopolistic price-gouging, their prices should be controlled and patents revoked.\n\nMain message: Well look, empirically, if you raised the minimum wage to an absurd level say 100\/hr. A big jump from 7.50 to 100. \n\nWhat would happen?\n\nWell, many firms would either try to pay their employees that are necessary increasing their expenses and thus they'd need to use money from investors, gross profits, or loans -  or they would lay off employees. \n\nBut it's important to realize why the price changes. I went into detail on that pdf I wrote up (that I guess people can't read?). The prices don't always shift upwards when bottom line costs increase. In most cases, employers won't raise the price out of fear that will lead to a \\*decline\\* in sales. A lot of times employers refuse to fire so many people because those people are the ones that are making them productive and making them able to make profits and maintain \\*market share.\\*\n\nThats the reality reflected in the minimum wage literature. \n\nBut, yes, JG is different. The notion is that inflation is actually caused by employers bidding up wage on their own accord to capture high demand. This wage increase feeds into demand and employers react by attempting to hire more employees to increase output. They can overshoot this and get into a bidding war but then end up not getting as much profits despite the increase in sales and output. Only then do they consider raising prices. They don't raise prices when they \\*dont\\* sell output. \n\nDemand pull inflation is this feedback loop of firms self-impiosing cost push of labor that feeds back into demand. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith JG, you dont get these extreme drops in consumption and demand due to unemployment, but the reason why its not inflationary is because its not producing an accelerating rate of inflation. In that process of inflation, stable demand, and full employment, the employer is in the bidding process with other firms, sure. But rather than competing for other people in the private sector, they pull from the JG pool of workers that are at the de facto lowest wage possible. The deficit spending component of increased demand is cut off and the demand stabilizes.",

If that\u2019s the case then everyone is a centrist except for Nazis and Anarchists (or those actually committing violence)\n\nAnd that\u2019s the full point of this meme I think. \n\nMajority of \u201ccentrists\u201d are either republicans using it as a facade to try and be taken more seriously when criticizing the left or liberals who misunderstand \u201ccentrist\u201d as being someone who doesn\u2019t support left wing or right wing violence.\n\nIf you find that the majority of your stances align with the \u201cleft\u201d then you aren\u2019t really a centrist. I think the issue is self described centrists believe the \u201ccenter\u201d makes up 90% of the political spectrum and only the 5% on either side of that makes up the \u201cright and left\u201d\n\nWith a generic description like that, I could be considered a centrist although I have always voted democrat, support UBI and universal healthcare, am pro choice, want more taxes on the elite and wealth redistribution and housing for the homeless simply because I agree with some people on the right that the \u201cwoke\u201d crowd is annoying af.\n\nCentrism isn\u2019t \u201csometimes agreeing with criticisms from both sides\u201d\n\nMain message: As I'm sure you and everybody else does I discuss my stance on a particular subject whether it be right leaning or left.  I criticize the use of violence on both sides except in cases of self defense.  My biggest criticism of both sides is their intolerance of any position other than there own.  I do criticize the suggestion of replacing capitalism with socialism (I believe in socializing basic human rights ie Healthcare and education).  I don't really defend the right almost at all most of our problems today originated on the right.  Its mainly the far left and far right that tends to draw my criticism and that is usually because they tend to be intolerant of anyone that does not believe the way they do.  Im sure that a more right leaning centrist does exactly as you imply as there beliefs would be more in line with the right than the left.  However a lot of centrist are left leaning meaning we tend to defend the left as it's more in line with our beliefs.  I tend to lean left.  However as a centrist I not only tolerate different views I encourage friendly discussion on a subject and am open to changing my mind if given sufficient reasoning.  Neither the left nor the right are inherently bad.  It tends to be the far left and the far right with the most bad actors.",

Leaving the Democratic party will make it worse if anything, since he's said himself that many independents are right wing and that will be his new audience to pander to.  \n\n&gt;Also, on a personal level, I\u2019ll admit there has always been something of an odd fit between me and the Democratic Party.  I\u2019m not very ideological.  I\u2019m practical.  Making partisan arguments \u2013 particularly expressing what I often see as performative sentiment \u2013 is sometimes uncomfortable for me.\n\nImplying that being a Democrat and being practical are incompatible also seems rather strange to me, as does him saying that being performative isn't practical.  \nWasn't his whole campaign about making people more aware of UBI even though he was never likely to win? He clearly does understand the value of being performative, he just pretends not to to shit on the Democrats, even though he himself has been a part of that and will probably continue doing it after leaving the Democratic party, except he'll now aim it at a right wing audience...\n\nMain message: I imagine most of the people on here shitting on Yang didn't actually read his article and just blindly assume this is another Dave Rubin situation",

Some problems require more robust solutions than just giving people a pittance.\n\nMain message: the whole \"but it'd just go to rent\" is pretty disingenuous anyway, since you could say that about literally anything that gives the working class more money. The bottom line is, adding a constant to a population's value WILL decrease wealth inequality, no matter what way you look at it. People's aversion to UBI honestly seems more rooted in it being done by a candidate who is running against the leftist sweetheart candidate.

Studies bear out the reality that people work more or less the same amount, basic income or no. \n\nThis is not to say there aren't workers now who, with a basic income, would stop working, but with the employment market as it is, this would likely be a very good thing. An en-masse stoppage of work, however, would be unexpected, considering the available evidence.\n\n&gt;People demand higher prices for wages, but the wages need to go up so much that prices rise. As prices rise, wages rise more, leading to more price rises. This would have the potential to sink UBI.\n\nThis is a strange loop. Wages are not calculated off of prices. As prices rise, there's no definite correlation between that change in price and a similar change in wage. The system of feedback you've described doesn't exist in reality.\n\nIn actuality, wages and price of goods are calculated entirely separately from one another, by the intersection of the supply and demand. An increase in one doesn't necessarily entail an increase in the other.\n\nThe fact that workers can better bargain for their wages, universally, is a good thing if our goal is to respond in a meaningful way to greater and greater volumes of globalization and automation. \n\nMain message: How could a potential wage price spiral be counteracted?",

I am perfectly aware of the economics of inequality and I am familiar with a number of lectures in this domain (sadly it doesn't look like that one in particular seem to touch basic income which I feel is perhaps the most progressive and interesting stance attempting to address economic disparity).\n\nWho do you you think runs the government? There is a classic quote in life the only things assured are death and taxes (I am a bit of an idealist in that I don't think taxes are an assured quality of a social structured existence). So... what happens if a lot of people say they won't pay their taxes? You see, through and through you have innumerable actions you can take which lead to \"poke, provoke, confront, elevate\" our current governance. Too many people are watching those damn lectures, being intellectual know it alls, that they are completely apathetic to any action -- truly any means of moving forward is annilhated by their own ability to limit themselves. That's what's going on here, we the people, our ancestory Americans, they surrounded part of their citizenship at some point in lieu of a security. But this is a false security, our government won't last forerver -- none of them do, and instead of seeking to serve our neighbors, as citizens, we have all become whores over paper... but yea, I agree we currently cannot do anything because simply we have destroyed our own potential for a life full of free-will. \n\nEDIT: I am pointing to the concept of free-will because I am trying to illuminate the state of how modern society approaches these \"decisions\" and how large sum of physicists are arguing that free will doesn't really exists (i.e all actions are fundamentally deterministic re-actions). I point to this because it's fun to philosophically think about but ultimately adds little to no value with respect to making a decisions with regard towards an action (i.e. having a thought that leads to a measurable action). In other words, it's a fun way to try to make sense of a big system but when you get down to the individual, the only solution is non-action. In fact, I am so driven to non-action with respect to our governance that I do not vote (and the total populous moving in this direction is growing). So ultimate, no matter what governance rules, there is no \"free will\" to really chose even in the physics of our mind, so how\/why could our governance be different? Our inaction to change our governance is a reflection of our lack of insight into how we change ourselves and how we project \"ourselves\". \n\nMain message: &gt; Yet, \"you\" still want to use \"they\", as if our governance is in no way shaped by our, \"we the people\", actions.\n\nTo be fair, it is currently not: https:\/\/youtu.be\/SzS068SL-rQ?t=645",

Yeah if your low enough income you get a small rebate but its still fuck all compared to what you pay. \n\nYang conveniently leaves that part out. VAT will be passed onto the consumer.\n\nBut either way unless UBI is more than the benefits the poor receive they'll be earning less. \n\nIf anything COVID proves UBI will fail. I live in Canada and I know people who aren't getting jobs just so they can collect the $2000 a month.\n\nMain message: Um you are ignoring Yangs VAT which is 100% part of the UBI package - value added tax, this directly targets the increase income inequality, by disproportionately taxing those that spend more. Its a 10% tax on all luxury goods and services purchased\n\nThe UBI is literally funded not by the poor, but by the people and companies that will spend more than $120,000 ANNUALLY aka the wealthy and big businesses. Everyone that spends less than $120,000 has a net gain from the UBI VAT system. But you can't have one without the other your right, it wouldn't make sense. But that is not what is proposed. UBI and VAT have to go hand in hand, UBI gives the money to the people and increases spending power and the economy. The VAT reels the money back in from those that financially do not need it.\n\nMeanwhile the economy is stimulated and local communities and states will have ENORMOUS increases in the local economy.",

    "text":"Comment response: The issue here is that \"UBI\" can mean a variety of different things.\n\nThe most important attribute that you've failed to mention is how much money the UBI in your \"study\" awarded people. It would be trivially easy to save money with a UBI if the total amount awarded was less than the amount spent on the social safety net. But that's likely not enough to qualify as a living stipend.\n\nNext, the raw math on proposals like this doesn't work out in practice, because nobody is going to be willing to completely dismantle the safety net. \n\nOne, because not everybody has the same needs (e.g. what if a woman has 5 kids? Clearly, she needs more than a UBI based on 2 kids). Two, because people can still waste their UBI (e.g. drug addiction\/mental illness) - and are we literally going to let them starve to death at that point? Or go homeless? Probably not, so there would still be backup programs to prevent these scenarios.\n\nAll in all, these discussions on UBI are only productive when you lay out *exactly* what you mean by UBI. Otherwise, I've found that UBI proponents have a slippery way of citing all of the benefits of all types of UBI, while simultaneously dismissing criticisms by referring to the cheapest options.\n\nMain message: Studies have shown that the system would save over a trillion over the course of 5 years if we slowly replaced every entitlement program with UBI, no more section 8, no more foodstamps, no more social security, no more WIC...all UBI...you get a steady check or deposit,  \n\nit would also reduce the bureaucracy, too.",

People on welfare are decidedly in a position where they need MORE help, not equal help. If everyone gets $1,000\/mo in buying power and you take away the programs that help those least able to take care of themselves, you're just pricing those people out of being able to use that $1,000 the way it's supposedly intended, which is to be spent.\n\nMain message: [Here is Yang's proposal to pay for UBI.](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq\/)\n\n1) He estimates $800 billion will come from ending current welfare programs. However, the lion's share of that $800 billion is [$500 billion in Medicaid funding](https:\/\/www.lexingtonlaw.com\/blog\/finance\/welfare-statistics.html), which [Yang is separately proposing be covered and paid for by a Medicare for All plan.](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/policies\/medicare-for-all\/) So while his left hand is promising $500 billion in savings, his right hand is claiming that we're going to continue to spend that $500 billion through a universal healthcare plan.\n\nThe remaining $300 billion is made up of a variety of programs, some of which Yang admits won't be refunded to pay for the UBI because anybody who currently draws more than the UBI from welfare can keep their welfare. \n\n2) Another $800-900 billion will come from \"new revenue\" derived from increased economic activity, which Yang thinks would be upwards of $2.5 trillion.\n\nBut the [US GDP is currently $20.5 trillion](https:\/\/www.bea.gov\/news\/2019\/initial-gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-annual-2018), meaning that growing by $2.5 trillion would be 10% year over year growth. The [US has averaged only 3.2% growth per year since 1948, and has struggled to average even 2% over the last ten years.](https:\/\/tradingeconomics.com\/united-states\/gdp-growth-annual)\n\nWhich means Yang is projecting **5X** growth overnight compared to the last ten years, and **3X** growth compared to the last 70 years of history. And that it will stick and never retract. Forever. That's outlandish, unfounded, and is exactly the sort of bullshit that the Republicans tried to argue during the tax cut debates. \n\n3) Yang expects a VAT to generate about $800 billion in revenue, and while this is probably the only area so far where he probably could theoretically generate the money, it has it's own set of problems. \n\nYang is arguing that his UBI would spur economic activity and therefore generate tax revenue to pay for the UBI. A VAT is going to act as a wet blanket for such activity, taking out dollars just as the UBI is injecting them. It won't be a 1 for 1 ratio, obviously, but it's something that Yang's proposal doesn't seem to even take into account. \n\n4) The remainder of the funding gap would be filled in by a variety of other, smaller, taxes - including a mishmash of taxes on the rich, taxes on carbon, and taxes on speculative financial transactions. \n\nYang doesn't even try to estimate numbers here, and just hand waves it away as being enough. \n\nBut there's two big problems there - carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes are self defeating *by design*. Their entire point is to shrink those activities by making them less profitable. So the more you tax, the less overall revenue you get because people stop engaging in that activity. \n\nThe problem being that Yang specifically now wants to rely on that revenue to partially fund UBI.\n\nIt doesn't work. His entire funding proposal is built on shifting sands and desperate wishes.",

    "text":"Comment response: I seem to find myself repeating this point a lot; the evolution of production is not simply about machines getting smarter. It's also about machines getting smaller, more flexible, lower in minimum production volumes toward manufacture-on-demand, and, most-importantly, cheaper. The factory is already an anachronism. Production is demassifying, localizing, commodifying and will ultimately disperse into automated distribution networks which will eventually become integrated into the infrastructure of the built habitat as a public utility like the Internet. Amazon is destined to evolve into a public utility. We are creating an 'Internet of Stuff'. \n\nSo automation isn't just obsolescing jobs, it's obsolescing capital as well. The upper-class is in the same boat as the rest of us, even if, for a longer time, they can insulate themselves from the impacts. Corporations are already divesting in ownership of production because amortization is a drag on competitiveness. The volume of consumer goods produced in job-shops surpassed that of traditional factories in 2000 and never went back. The number of products you can now initiate production for out-of-pocket in facilities on the scale of a 2-4 car garage is steadily increasing. Industrial designers and hobbyists are increasingly turning into independent manufacturers. The city of Barcelona recently pledged to become industrially self-sufficient in the next couple of decades. The next Apple computer will be a company composed of handfuls of people whose jobs are primarily about design, engineering, marketing, and the management of product 'spimes'. They will own no production. All production will be in the network bringing the end-product to the consumer, initiated by smart-contracts linked to product spimes. \n\nSo the rich are likely to see many forms of wealth turn into Confederate scrip and the poor will increasingly have ownership--personally or through societal ownership of the municipal infrastructure--of the means of production. UBI may evolve into what I call an IBI--an 'integrated' basic income, so called because it is coded into the production network so as to provide goods 'free-within-reason' on-demand, thus allowing Social Capital systems to supercede our current archaic economics. \n\n\nMain message: Any suggestions for stemming the feeling of incredible powerlessness that the logical conclusions of futurology create?",

When this starts to happen on a large enough scale, if you want to keep Capitalism going, you have to do something to give this people an income. So you do UBI.\n\nYang also wants to cut welfare and offer UBI instead. This is another thing Libertarians want. If you Google Libertarianism and UBI you'll get lots of articles on Libertarian websites advocating for UBI as a Libertarian idea. They see it as preferable to normal welfare. I'd say it's not agreed about among Libertarians, though.\n\nEither way, the way Yang wants it implemented cannot be called socialist, he's doing it as a capitalist trying to save capitalism. Throw in the alt-right stuff, and I think it's fair to call him a Libertarian.\n\nMain message: A Libertarian would not center their platform around mandatory free money from the government.

    "text":"Comment response: Let me ask you this. Are the majority of people you meet on a daily basis good responsible people? What percentage of people do you NOT trust to spend that money wisely?\n\nThe data from UBI suggests that the majority of people would benefit from it. Isn\u2019t that good enough if the majority of people are using it responsibly? \n\nWait, are you against all social programs? Because how they are used isn\u2019t much different than UBI. Food stamps have been used irresponsibly, but overall they still help families positively who need it. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t want to restrict UBI. It would increase administrative costs and also single out people for how they use it. You want it available to everyone equally so that no one is singled out, you aren\u2019t pushing the money towards specific businesses, etc.\n\nMain message: I'm in the same boat really. I like the sound of the idea, I'm just worried about Yang just giving people the money and trusting them to spend it properly. Like he claims the data supports the idea that with secure, extra income, people make better financial decisions, but I would still prefer some sort of restriction, like you *have* to prove that the money you spend was on like a small business or something that would benefit the economy and not your local drug dealer. But if that were the case I can see the people that actually need it not using it because it's got extra steps or is too complex, and the system just doesn't work.",

That argument is based on \"personal responsibility\", which is more of a right wing argument IMO. Why force people to live in an antiquated sub optimal system from when gender roles were a thing (child support is a thing primarily because back in the day women didnt work and men did) when we can engineer a better system that provides better outcomes\/freedom for all?\n\nAlso, if we are stuck in the current system, and we do need to assign responsibility to someone, maybe it should be on the one who decided to have a kid against the father's will in the first place?",

It\u2019s voter manipulation at its best. You can skew a whole election that way. That isn\u2019t democracy. \n\n\nTrump will be prosecuted for all he has done don\u2019t worry.

If they don\u2019t do these things after a pandemic then they arnt a left party. The Democrats are more right side than we like. The DNC is evil and manipulated, and that is a big problem.

If you still need explanation go re-read reddiquette, the second one under the \"Don't\" section is what this is.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/wiki\/reddiquette\n\nMain message: i call it reporting cheaters, But meh call it what u want. Zero tolerance for them get caught in one ubisoft game for cheating they should be banned from all their online games imo. hell i wish ubisoft would use vac so they would get banned from vac games also.\n\nI do see how \/ why you could call this witch-hunting tho. But maybe just maybe if we show ubisoft we are sick of cheaters they might actually do something about it.\n\nWe as a Community could atleast shun the player and avoid playing with them",

    "text":"Comment response: This is actually one reason I've become more in favor of UBI. While there are definite pros and cons to it overall one potential pro is that it should (in theory) loosen up credit by making low income people less of a risk. After all if everyone has a guaranteed minimum income from the government then it should be possible to setup lines of credit using that income as a collateral.\n\nMain message: The entire fucking credit system. \n\nIt is easy, so easy to get money - when you have money.   \n\nIf you are poor and need a small low interest loan from an established financial institution, GOOD FUCKING LUCK.  Your only options are predatory lenders who are going to charge a handling fee, plus exhorbinant interest because Money Mart knows they are the only option and the can.\n\nHowever, if you have a bit of money banks basically throw credit at you. Lines of Credit, Multiple Credit Cards, and it doesn't stop there.   You become the target of agressive marketing.  For things you didn't even think you would need \"Hey, want to take out a loan to contribute to retirement savings\", \"Have you considered a loan so that you can invest \", \"We noticed you don't have a mortgage - want one?\"\n\nBanks are willing to throw multiple times what a person with a little bit of money makes in a year at them, however - won't loan a poor person a fraction of their monthly wage.",

Its just like with raising minimum wage, the core of the problem, corporations and greed, is never addressed and the cost of living just goes up along with the wages and youre actually even worse off.\n\nMain message: Pretty much the second one.  There's added expenses to working, like transportation or childcare, that doesn't need to be paid if you're at home collecting ODSP (if you're home all day, you dont need to pay someone to watch your kids, you can do that). \n\nSo if you're barely making ends meet with ODSP, and get a job that pays enough to get you kicked off ODSP, but not enough to pay those extra expenses, you're better off to stay on ODSP.  But that means you cant actually get out of poverty - that minimum wage job may lead to later advancements to a better paying career, but you cant afford to take it.\n\n  So you're stuck on ODSP unless you can land a job that pays enough to cover everything... but you can't get that job with no experience or education... which you cant afford to get.  This creates a gap where you'll need to be extremely lucky to escape ODSP and to get yourself financially stable.\n\nThis is one of the reasons why some people push for a Universal Basic Income (UBI) - because a UBI cant be taken away from you, any work you do at all is going to help you.  It removes that gap where getting a job might make you worse off financially than just staying on ODSP.",

People on both sides of the political spectrum are taken by the concept because it seems to address the concerns of both.\n\nThose who think that government or free-enterprise solutions are inherently better forget that both are systems with rules controlling the flow of money and resources; both systems rely on trust to a great extent and they both tend to attract opportunists.

Such scenarios involve deadweight loss, where the tax has lowered people's welfare by making some mutually beneficial transactions undesirable. Taxing land and rewarding a UBI both do not do this. \n\nAn extremely high UBI could dissuade work, but this doesn't cost anyone else higher land rent. In fact it would lower their rent.

Looking at the median income by country there are many where incomes are miniscule (https:\/\/worldpopulationreview.com\/country-rankings\/median-income-by-country) to the point where 690k would last multiple lifetimes. Shocking an area with that amount of wealth would be dangerous and could cause dramatic inflation and end up making people worse off if not done very carefully. \n\nI'm not against dramatic solutions to inequality, we need to get creative, but it is more complex than just throwing money around at such large volumes. I'm no fan of billionaires, and this isn't a critique of the \"taking money\" part of your plan, just the \"giving money\" part. \n\nThis reminds me of the stories of King Mansa Musa handing out gold along his Trek across Africa and totally ruining the economies of the area and making people worse off. It also reminds me of the stories of people ruining their life after winning the lottery. \n\nIf a plan were made to redistribute wealth like this it would need to be either adjusted for local cost of living or be spread over a long period to give areas time to adjust. I'm not against giving people cash, UBI, or anything of the sort, but giving someone multiple lifetimes of wealth out of the blue would likely be a bad idea. \n\n-----\n\nOkay I said I wasn't critiquing the \"taking money\" part but I do have a few comments. \n\nSadly the wealth calculation you gave is probably not all wealth that people are able to use and probably couldn't all be converted to cash for people to spend. (A rural farmer with no internet access probably isn't helped by having shares of Amazon stock). I'd guess that liquidating all that value would probably erase a ton of it and people would end up with a lot less. Still life-changing amounts I'm sure, but not as much as you list. \n\nFinally there's the awkward corner case of people with modest retirement savings saved over a lifetime of work and are unable to continue working. Taking their wealth would leave them struggling. Granted, that wealth will probably still help a dozen people so this may be worthwhile for the sake of the argument here, but it's a case to consider. \n\n----\n\nMy point is basically it's good to think of plans like this, then just theoretically, but the reality of it is more complex. I do believe we should take dramatic steps, but they also need to be informed steps.\n\nMain message: I\u2019m going to say that I\u2019m for dividing the wealth.\nA rough guess of the worlds total wealth is $5,000 TRILLION. Or 5 quadrillion. And in this world with so much money, we have literal starving children, homeless veterans, diseases. A shortage of nurses and doctors, hospitals, libraries. We have corrupt politicians and multi billionaire businessmen. \n\nIf we divided $5,000 trillion by every human on the planet, each human would receive roughly $690,000. That\u2019s as a one off payment that helps every single individual. Business would expand and other businesses would start up. It would drive a housing and baby boom and pay off so much debt. It would help many families and help poorer countries to build. \n\nThe people who have earned the wealth still have their companies and the people with high end degrees still keep their jobs. \n\nIt literally only gives the poorer countries and the working class a chance to better themselves. It isn\u2019t enough to make them settle down and never work and it isn\u2019t that much that the billionaires couldn\u2019t afford to live. \n\nWhy would anyone be against this?",

Bezos made his money off of other rich people.

Finance creates money for them. As more and more companies realize they can get higher returns by making bets on abstract indexes such as GDP, inflation, the stock market, the weather, who will win the Oscars, or whatever, selling widgets will become less important as a source of profit. A company can produce enough real goods for high-end customers and ignore the low-value customers, because they can make bets on the weather or whatever, hedge them, and come out ahead no matter what. Or a company can bet on inflation then raise its prices to seed inflation. Or a company can bet on GDP going down then produce less to make GDP go down. (If the company hedges right, it will still make money if GDP goes up, but perhaps not as much as if they took a position on GDP going down.)\n\nThe idea that private profit requires consumers with jobs ignores Piketty's finding that r &gt; g. Companies can make more from purely financial investments, and only produce enough goods to satisfy the demands of those who, like themselves, are making enough money from investments to afford whatever inflated prices they charge for throttling production of real goods.",

It's also regressive if you have a really shitty job. Knowing some of the welfare benefits, a person could expect to see maybe $800 in rental assistance, $190 in SNAP, and say $800 in SSA, UBI would would effectively reduce their spending power by 50%.",

And that should be what we are aiming for.  \n\n\nNo welfare? You think majority of starving people will just vote for that? No. Replace welfare with UBI and TAX children. That's a far more sensible move. You get enough votes. Most children will have richer parents. Only parents that can fully afford their children and pay those extra tax can have children.\n\nRemoving government? You fucking kidding me? Instead, make government behaves like corporation. Each citizen has a share. Not much change, citizens can still vote. One man is still one vote (though some guys can buy more citizenships if the country is really fucked up)\n\nAllow people to sell citizenship. Don't like it here? Well, someone else want to get in. Okay you can rent or sell your citizenship. Perhaps people should rent first and then if they are sure they can sell.\n\nOpen border? Seriously. If you have open border, there are 1 billion chinese that will happily move. Now I know chinese are diligent and smart and stuff. But they have their own interests that don't necessarily match yours.  \n\n\nWhat about if communist party told them to vote communism? Voting right and open border don't mix and if I can choose among 2, democracy is still more practical. There are plenty of muslims that want to turn your country into shariah.  \n\n\nInstead of open border, make immigration simpler like buying and selling shares. Sell visa. If you can pay certain amount per  year, you can stay. After that you leave. A mexican want to work in US? He can just compute amount of money he will make, pay visa fee, move back out.  \n\n\nIt's already happening. US and many other countries \"give\" citizenship in exchange of investments. Many countries give citizenship for surrendering soldiers. It can be cheaper than killing enemies soldiers.\n\nTax children. Do NOT subsidize children. Can't afford them don't breed them. Every children deserve good genes, be wanted, and rich parents. If parents are poor there is NO libertarian solution to fix children with poor parents. The most libertarian solution is let the children starve. That's not purely libertarian because it's not the children's fault. It's also cruel and won't win vote.   \n\n\nSubsidize abortion and contraception. Again, if poor guy don't really want to have children, HELP THE FUCK OUT OF THEM. You want another socialist voters voting for more communism? What the fuck. Most poor kids are simply not genetically suited to contribute to economy.  \n\n\nTax land. Not income. It's much easier to compute. It doesn't even have to be precise. Government can say for these zones the tax is this much per square meter. For that zone the cost is that much. If government tax too much the price will drop and people move out. So as long as tax rate doesn't change too rapidly people that don't like it can just move. Ideally this should be proportional to reason.\n\nMain message: What's the least libertarian position you have?",

If you don't want people to fail, then you need both the UBI and the safety net.\n\nAs for the capitalist system itself, it's certainly possible for poor people to buy small shares of corporations for a few dollars of savings, and corporations would gladly sell them those shares.

They need a simple, straightforward savings system and central banking's interest manipulation has ruined that.\n\nMain message: However - by definition poor people do not have excess capital to risk in new business.

Like your tax info, current earnings and credit\/bank acct info stored on your phone can communicate with the consumer market and prices can be variable based on earnings. \n\nExample: Two people who live in the same county of a state scan the same QR code on a bag of chips with their phone. One earns 50k, the other earns 300k. The price of chips is $2 for the first person and $12 for the second person.\n\nIs that too simplified and are there problems to that type of approach? Does that type of strategy take away the encouragement to take on more difficult jobs to earn more money?\n\nMain message: UBI is horrible policy that would harm lower income folks and benefit the wealthy disproportionally. Universal basic assets and fighting wealth inequality are the true way to even the playing field. Otherwise you are just going to cause inflation that hurts the poor and it will remove means testing. UBI is equivalent to the company Toms donating pairs of shoes to Africa, it sounds great but really a more effective way of helping is to empower and create jobs to make their own shoes. So a Republican policy, you\u2019re right.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m getting downvoted for this because Reddit loves UBI and the Yang Gang. I am proposing something more progressive. As a counter-point to the response stating to raise taxes on the rich, what is going to keep a Republican government from just doing another huge tax cut on the rich after the UBI is implement? UBI by itself is not effective, I do agree that raising taxes on the rich would help but it is not really realistic right now with our government, lack of representation, and lobbying power from the rich. The system would be gamed with or without UBI, which pretty much just makes it a welfare system without means testing. Unless you start finding ways to help historically disenfranchised populations get assets like land and homes, nothing will change. UBA is more progressive and would lead towards effective reparations and fight against systemic racism. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.ozy.com\/the-new-and-the-next\/universal-basic-assets-a-smarter-fix-than-universal-basic-income\/90019\/",

    "text":"Comment response: 1. As you mentioned, it's not likely for 100% of a UBI to pass through right into rent, just like 100% of UBI won't pass through to increased prices in inflation. Sure some amount will, but anything that doesn't is still a transfer of purchasing power down to the lower end of the economic spectrum. This is pretty similar to the minimum wage debate, where conservatives suggest that it's pointless to increase wages because they'll just be eaten up by increased prices. I don't know of any UBI studies or predictions on this, but I suppose the amount between 0% and 100% passthrough comes down to how competitive the rental market is.\n2. Basically same as #1 if I'm reading this right. You can't hand-wave and skip to just declaring that UBI is \"not functional\" because *the parasites are basically probably going to raise medical fees by 100% of the UBI*. Sounds like Yang is on the right track if he says that UBI isn't a complete panacea.\n3. Localized cost-of-living universal safety-net spending seems like a way to give more money to the people who live in the most desirable places. In a world where people can move around, can work from home, can buy the same stuff from the internet, etc., it's always seemed a bit off to me to justify localizing pay\/benefits\/etc. Seems like the playing field should actually be leveled a bit more, rather than steering into this phenomenon of wildly divergent cost of living (which is a feedback loop).\n4. No idea, I was never a full fan of the more libertarian versions of UBI which also cared about immediately cutting other government programs at the same time.\n5. Seems like you're saying here that UBI isn't full fledged anti-capitalism, so it's both worse than doing nothing (which is at least basically accelerationism) and also means it's going to be easy to stop\/undo. Doesn't the 2nd part contradict the first worry? I think you have to pick one of these as the problem you're worried about, unless this is a very specific timing window problem. And in general, my response is that no candidate is anti-capitalist in the way you seem to want. Cutting student debt, going comprehensive MFA, increasing infrastructure spending, etc. are all also going to increase aggregate demand and supercharge the economy and consumption spending. The environment is a separate issue which deserves serious consideration, but that's not a way to knock UBI.\n\nMain message: Hey, Yang Gang: Let's Talk About UBI",

On climate change, yang willingness to put everything on the table including nuclear &amp; geoenginerring to solve the crisis differs from sanders. Yang wants to expand health insurance coverage just like sanders does, but also has many plans to fix the perverse incentives that are driving up costs in the industry. Obama tried to expand coverage without fixing the incentives &amp; it left the end result underwhelming.\n\nI think a federal jobs guarantee is okay if you also have UBI, but a FJG without UBI has the potential to quickly become dystopian. here's an article that I think nicely explains why.\n\n [https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2018\/05\/16\/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia\/](https:\/\/slatestarcodex.com\/2018\/05\/16\/basic-income-not-basic-jobs-against-hijacking-utopia\/) \n\nYang also goes farther then sanders on drug decriminalization. Yang wants to decriminalize opioids &amp; psilocybin. \n\nSanders I think doesn't understand tech as well as Yang does. Yang has many proposals lined out for various things from cryptocurrency to data privacy to online gambling.\n\nYang also goes further then others on net neutrality &amp; wants to unbundle local loops so that there's more competition. \n\nIn addition to the big stuff, Yang also addresses the small things that aren't priorities but add up. examples is something like abolishing the penny or automatic tax filing, fixing daylights savings time. everyone knows it should happen, but its not the most pressing thing so it never happens.\n\nHonestly i could go on but Yang has 150 policy pages on his website many of which have multiple proposals so I would just recommend digging in to see the differences.\n\nwww.yang2020.com\/policies\n\nMain message: Thanks for the response. That's really informative.  A lot of what you outlined sounds to me like what Sanders has always been touting.

In this plan, it is the wealthiest individuals which will fund the program. I understand this position though I'm not sure if it would be beneficial in the long run.\n\nI think of UBI in the context of automation, in which UBI is a solution to inevitable unemployment, and will be funded (at least in part) by the excess value generated from automation. \n\nI think both views are valid, simply different. \n\n\nMain message: You mean came from someone's dividends on the shares they bought with the money they made from the work their employees did? It's emotionally driven fantasy to pretend like everything is paid by poor hard done by reasonably well-off people who work for a living. More taxes come from the top of the wealth distribution, as they should. If they don't then THAT is the problem, not the horror of someone being granted the right to exist without misery because for whatever reason they can't find or do work.\n\nPeople can and absolutely do hoard wealth. Some of it does nothing but drive up the price of housing for those who already could barely afford it, for example. Some of it does need to be freed up and it circulates through the economy better when it is in the pocket of someone who is going to spend it on basic goods the second they get it instead of throwing it on the pile. Automation will only make this worse every single day, and more and more \"hard-working paycheck\" people will join the ranks of \"lazy moochers\" against their best efforts.",

Most businesses fail and to me that would seem like a decent enough of a chance for the society to take, but I'm happy to disagree on that point! Do note that in Finland, we have insanely lush unemployment benefits (see [here](http:\/\/www.tyj.fi\/eng\/earnings-related_allowance\/amount_of_allowance\/)) and what you describe is quite common. High unemployment benefits, indeed, are one of those barriers of employment that I mentioned - why would that woman you describe take an actual job if that meant losing out on plenty of time and only getting a meager income increase (compared to getting the benefit)? It doesn't make economical sense and that's exactly what UBI is trying to solve - to make it so that it would make sense for her to go back to work earlier!\n\nMain message: I knew some people that basically did this. They started their own businesses and used unemployment as a UBI basically while they grew their businesses. In most cases, this was just to supplement their income as unemployment is pretty meager. One woman I know started a nutrition counseling business. That kind of thing is basically life coaching with diet advice. She had to go and get a real job when unemployment finally wore out. (like 3 years later) She has a degree, and she had no problem finding a real job when she actually wanted one.\n\nWhat's funny too is she talks endlessly about how rich people are scum of the earth and how government is horrible to poor people, but she had no problem just living off of the government for years without even trying to find a job. I'm fine with someone collecting unemployment for 6 months like the program is intended for. A lot of people just need a bridge to find another good fit for their job situation. That's great, and their employer pays into it. It shouldn't cost the government anything, but then they extended it and now it was costing the taxpayers directly to subsidize all these people. ",

NIT might make it more tricky for the layman to understand what's going on with his taxes though. I\u2019ll take either.\n\nSome will say \u201cBut Work &amp; Income take care of all sorts of stuff other than basic benefits.\u201d Instead I think there could be kiosk type agents of the welfare system, housed in various places where they\u2019re most needed: hospitals, Plunket, universities, polytechs etc. You see one of those people if you have a need that your tax credit\/UBI can\u2019t fund. A dedicated bureaucracy for payment processing would still be needed on a lower level, but much of what W&amp;I do can go.\n\nSure, under NIT or UBI beneficiaries aren\u2019t being given stick to get a job, but I don\u2019t think that matters. W&amp;I have such a toxic culture, if everyone is spared of their meddling and control and how they effectively own you, the net effect on society can only be positive.\n\nThen we can stop this nonsense where everyone\u2019s applying for jobs they don\u2019t want just to please W&amp;I, and employers can\u2019t tell from the stack of applicants who actually wants the job and who doesn\u2019t. It sucks when you\u2019re the one who wants the job.\n\nThen there\u2019s W&amp;I overseeing your job search. You might have them say \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say this in a cover letter\u201d, then you ask an at interview \u201cWhat part of my cover letter made me stand out?\u201d and they tell you it was that exact part.  Just about everyone\u2019s a trumped up expert on what employers want to hear, but employers are as consistent as people are in general, and the people at W&amp;I have no special insight, but they own you, and you\u2019re doing it on their terms. They'll have you LARPing as someone less skilled than you are with a dumbed down CV in attempt to get you into the shittiest of jobs.\n\nI once went into W&amp;I Riccarton wanting to print my CV and a cover letter, as there was a job I really wanted and the ad didn\u2019t state an online way to apply. The printing kiosks were out of order, or it was prior to the kiosks. I asked at reception if I could email it to them so they could print it for me. They said no. They referred me to the old Riccarton library, saying they had printing there. Turns out they didn\u2019t. I had to go to a Copy Centre. W&amp;I were totally unenthused about the job I was applying for; they didn't think it sounded very good. It was a job I was willing to do; that was all that matters. (W&amp;I are like controlling parents: they want you to do *these* jobs, and not those other ones you're interested in.)\n\nAnother time:  \nMe: \u201cWell can *you* get me a job then?\u201d  \nThem: \u201cWe don\u2019t do that. We just give you the tools you need to get a job on your own.\u201d\n\nIs this useless bureaucracy worth the cost, when you could get the money to people another way?\n\nMain message: Announcing an AMA with new The Opportunities Party leader Raf Manji this Wednesday 9 February, from 7:00pm!",

    "text":"Comment response: Someone once told me that the mean IQ around here is estimated to be 140. That seems extraordinary, but, let's say I play along and buy that most of the locals are extremely intelligent, and that IQ determines everything the most ardent HBDers claim. The [average income](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheMotte\/comments\/g717ft\/two_views_of_survey_data_the_modal_motte_user_a\/) is around the 70th percentile (individual, not household) for the USA; I suspect it would be significantly higher if we excluded students\/foreigners and normalized for age. Presumably we're up there educationwise as well. \n\nMy question for you is this: if you believe all of the above, does it confer some  heightened responsibility towards society and\/or humanity? Do all citizens bear the same responsibility regardless of ability? Or do none of us owe the other anything outside of our families\/immediate social circles? If we're genuinely 'elites' in some sense of the word, do we have obligations to lead, to educate, to work behind the scenes to improve the world? Is having\/raising children, voting, paying taxes, obeying the law and so on and so forth part of our duty as modern citizens? On a slightly related note - do you think we collectively live up to our potential? \n\nI've always felt a deep obligation to the collective (be it my social circle, nation or humanity as a whole) on multiple levels. Without throwing opsec completely to the winds, I'm extremely physically healthy, decidedly neurotypical (though no doubt some of you think otherwise), tall and fairly average looking. Significant sums of taxpayer money have enabled my education and current occupation. My upbringing could be described as lower middle class. I'm firmly of the opinion that society owes the latter as a bare minimum to every child, and those of us that have benefited have a moral obligation to do everything we can to extend a ladder to those less fortunate.\n\nThis manifests on a personal level, where I've shouldered greater financial\/physical\/other burdens for friends\/family\/partners. On a social level, I volunteer, attempt to educate the public on issues related to my field, donate a fixed fraction of my income to charity. On a larger scale, I'd strongly support foreign aid and investment, UBI, welfare and long-term dissolution of nations. I'm undecided as to whether I should be doing more or less, whether I'm living up to my own potential and whether the path I've chosen is the most benefit I can be to humanity.\n\nI realize this runs counter to the worldview of a significant fraction of Americans. To the rugged individualists out there, what are your thoughts?\n\nMain message: Culture War Roundup for the Week of November 09, 2020",

It is funded by a regressive VAT. There is no fucking requirement to fund FD with VAT. None. VAT is regressive. Find another fucking FD funding mechanism and I'll stop bitching.\n\n3. It should be put on top of a robust social safety net, not implemented as a competition.

    "text":"Comment response: I don\u2019t understand who would hire a disabled person otherwise. I wouldn\u2019t, because it\u2019s not economically viable. \n\nI\u2019ve said this before and said it again: people should work to the extent that they can and can consent to, even if their productive capacity isn\u2019t very high. The government then provides a subsidy to the individual to bring their total income up to the minimum wage level. So let\u2019s say minimum wage is 10 donuts and the employer provides 6 donuts and then the government provides 4 donuts.\n\nIf we don\u2019t do that, then they won\u2019t have jobs at all and will have to live off welfare, which is designed to be below minimum wage so people will always be made better off by working. And the government would have to pay the full unemployment\/disability amount, let\u2019s say 8 donuts. The individual gets less, and society pays more, and everyone is worse off.\n\nI think both minimum wage and welfare caps should be higher, by the way. Nor am I sure that universal basic income isn\u2019t the way to go. \n\nThe world is an inherently unfair place. Wages don\u2019t correlate to effort, they pretty much correlate to innate ability (with a dash of luck and a dash of work ethic, but I maintain that it\u2019s mostly genetic lottery. And I don\u2019t mean who you\u2019re born to, but who you\u2019re born as.) \n\nIt\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m depressed and Jim isn\u2019t; should I get more money to buy things so I can compensate and be closer to Jim\u2019s happiness?\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that someone can go to law school and get a job making 200k the second they graduate, and other people can\u2019t because they aren\u2019t smart enough to succeed and get admitted. But how are we supposed to fix that? If everything paid the same, or close to the same, everyone would just do the easier and less stressful jobs. \n\nLife has always been unfair. Some cave people were bigger, more efficient hunters and had more time to sleep and relax, for instance. \n\nAnd don\u2019t downvote me to oblivion because you don\u2019t agree with me. If you don\u2019t agree, explain why.\n\nMain message: Should intellectually disabled people be allowed to work for below minimum wage? (debate on Quora)",

When labor moves to where it can generate the highest return, a land value tax of equal amount does not follow it. Rather, the land value tax is avoidable, and drops off to zero at marginal land. The opposite is the case for a poll tax. When labor moves to where it can generate the highest return, a poll tax of equal amount follows it, even if the worker moves to worse quality land which can produce far less. Poll taxes and land value taxes are opposites, as a poll tax is a tax designed to fall solely on production rather and not at all on rent, whereas a land value tax is designed to fall solely on rent, and not at all on production.\n\n&gt; After all the prices we pay for privately purchased goods and services don't depend on our income levels or the amount of capital we own.\n\nYes they do. With privately purchased goods and services we have the option to vary the combinations and quality of goods and services we are purchasing to maximize our utility within a given budget, and change our purchasing behavior based on our income and property. With a poll tax, there is no such flexibility. The better analogy to purchases of privately provided goods and services would be user fees, as user fees are purchases of publicly provided goods and services. However user fees are not synonymous with poll taxes, as fees are for acquiring an additional unit of a good or services, whereas taxes are compulsory payments for general revenues and public goods which may be non-excludable.\n\n&gt; If such payments were made as a citizens dividend, along with all the other user fees, Pigou Taxes, royalties currently collected by the state, then indeed a Poll Tax would be the only fair\/necessary tax.\n\nA poll tax would still be neither fair nor necessary. If the government has cut the dividend to zero, is collecting a 100% LVT, is collecting additional taxes on environmental externalities, and still does not have sufficient revenue, it should either cut spending or issue bonds, not authorize the collection of a poll tax. Poll taxes would never be openly supported by a major political coalition in United States, due to their historical use as means to disenfranchise minorities and prevent Black Americans from voting.",

I can't imagine that to be the case anywhere in the US at $3,000\/yr.\n\nThis way, if you gave people the money to cover the necessities, then you would have the best effects of basic income.  People could quit their jobs if their jobs aren't treating them well, but still have enough money to live on without having to have another job lined up before quitting their old one.  People could refuse to take jobs which offer too little, so that you'd see labor costs getting more rational.

As for downsides:\n\n-Kids pose an issue. If you give parents of kids UBI for their kids, it would drive up the costs of the program, possibly reward irresponsibility if you have like 5 kids, and create a loophole for illegal immigrants to exploit. On the other hand, it may be harmful to kids of single mothers if only adults get UBI.\n\n-Cost. It would be very expensive, and would require major spending cuts in welfare as well as much higher taxes to afford. Since the rich would bear the brunt of it (it's very redistributive), this sends right wingers into a frenzy.\n\n-Alleged disincentive to work. However, there's not much evidence that this exists, since living on UBI would be difficult and somewhat uncomfortable. Sure, some would stop working, but with a labor surplus and trends toward automation, thats a good thing.\n\n-Possible inflation. However, to the best of my knowledge, since no money is being printed, inflation won't actually take place. The price on some items will go up with the extra demand it provides, but at the same time, it's reasonable to assume the price of some goods will go down as demand goes down (\"inferior goods\"), and there will ultimately be a \"zero sum\" effect so inflation should not occur. Another reason to assume inflation will not be a big problem is because the current welfare system and other social programs don't cause it either.",

    "text":"Comment response: For uplifting content, your mileage may vary, but one I've found that helps counterbalance the \"oh god fuck everything\" funk I can get into after listening to too much BtB is Solveable, by Pushkin Industries (aka Malcolm Gladwell and Jacob Weisberg). \n\nIt does have a bit of an establishment bent to it, due to the founders, but they do valuable work seeking out and interviewing people who are doing the work to help solve massive global problems (aka homelessness, voter suppression, destructive agriculture, etc). Not only is the research they bring to light fascinating, but they always include ways for listeners to get involved in pushing back against these massive systemic problems. \n\nAnother pod that can be a good antidote to that \"fuck everything\" vibe is Terrible, Thanks for Asking, which is from a host who went through a barrage of horrible personal shit (miscarriage, her father died unexpectedly of a heart attack, her husband died of a sudden and lethal brain tumor). She spent a lot of time after that wanting to be honest about how much she was hurting, instead of performing resilience for the comfort of others. \n\nShe started this podcast (a couple years later) as a platform for honest discussions with people who've been through awful things and have scars from their experiences, but it's actually a really cathartic listen. Sometimes awful shit happens, and you just have to grind your way through it, but end up learning things you wouldn't expect from those experiences. There's no sugarcoating, but it's hopeful in a way I recognize, as somebody who's also been in some dark places.\n\nThe best counter to nihilism I've found isn't a podcast but a book that came out recently, that I've often been tempted to send to whatever P.O. box is available to creepy fans of the pod. It's called Humankind, by Rutger Bregman, and it's a historic\/sociological analysis of how humanity views human nature and how that affects social policy and social stratification. \n\nDude's an impressive researcher, and comes up with serious data to prove that human nature isn't inherently awful, but rather that the stratification of society through private property and the construction of in-groups and out-groups is what leads to the terrible things humans can do to other humans. He goes in-depth on elite panic and other such research R. Evans has brought up on the pod, and is open about believing in anarchism as the political theory with the most potential for organizing a just society. He's written another book, Utopia for Realists, about the social experiments people are doing to figure out how best to establish a just society (aka universal basic income, open borders, etc), but admittedly I haven't read that one.  It's on my to-read list, though.\n\nHope you find some value in these!\n\nMain message: Uplifting Content?",

Socialist healthcare policies, such as forcing employers to pay for healthcare, have been driving up healthcare prices in the US for decades. Government control of the healthcare industry has also been driving up costs for decades.\n\n&gt; its literally a massive chunk of private money going to private insurance\n\n...That is controlled by the government.\n\nMain message: Sure, I'll even do a big one. Single Payer and other forms of Socialist health care systems. To start many other counties have these systems in place so we have the massive advantage of being able to see in real functioning countries these systems at work and examine there weakness and advantages. That would not only mean we have several models to base new ones off of, but we can also compare real data on the effectiveness of their systems verse systems like the current one in the US. The easiest numbers to point to there are counties with these systems have longer life expediencies and lower mother mortality rates during child birth. On top of that they also do this while using less of the counties GDP when compared to most, this is commonly cited as the \"US spends the most but does the worst\" point. Now here is the second big factor that comes from that, the U.S. spend the most not only federally but privately, its literally a massive chunk of private money going to private insurance that takes a % of it for their own profit which never goes to pay for actual medical work. So once you take the majority of the reasons for private coverage away (there are still places for extra insurance to exist even in counties with these system in place) you instantly take away one of the biggest experiences most people have in their lives and start covering those who can't afford that expense in the first place (some of that experience would be transitioned to taxes in theory but depending on the system it could achieve it with a similar amount of funding the US is already sending and\/or be taxes shifted away from other areas like military spending). This means more money in the hand of people who can spend it on things that more directly impact the economy rather then sinking even more money then the government is spending into making hospitals function and into the pockets of insurance companies who literally produce no products they just move money around from their customers to hospitals and to themselves. A job which would be greatly simplified by having it be a national program, if your covered for all no elective procedures under the single payer program then you don't spend time and money selling people different kinds of insurance that cost different rates.\n\nTLDR: \"Socialist\" health care systems and similar systems have been proven in other counties so we can compare real data on there effectiveness and out comes. Additional removing the great financial burden of health insurance could free up spending power in huge segments of the US population (if done effectively). On top of which removing the need for inefficient, massive, private, insurance systems for simplified government based programs.\n\nI apologize for any spelling or grammar errors in this post and additionally for factual mistakes I may have made I'm not a health care professional.",

We're basically testing UBI for five months. So that isn't it. \n\nMoreover the evidence is showing that many of the violent protestors are just political agitators either blakc propaganda (right wingers) or actual anarchists (which hidden tribes report shows are often wealthier whites). \n\nPoor working class aren't the ones rioting. They're the victims.\n\nMain message: The virus is the reason the protests are as intense as they are. A nation with barebone safety nets like the US is the nation Marx was talking about, only able to work if the populace is entertained with bread and circuses. 25 percent unemployment rate plus mass evictions on the horizon plus no movie theaters or live sports or any sort of mass gathering to look forward to along with the powder keg of continuous and unchecked police brutality is a perfect storm of shit.\n\nThis doesn't stop until the officers are prosecuted or Congress implements UBI or until sports returns. A lot of people literally have nothing better to do and nothing else left to lose; all bets are off.",

The first thing I did when leaving my employer twitch a pension was roll it into a t-IRA. \n\nIndividuals having control over those funds is preferable IMO. \n\nFrom a public policy perspective I would rather shore up SS than see pensions come back. The focus should remain on fixing and simplifying 401k\/IRA systems.",

    "text":"Comment response: &gt; we're using the unstable financial sector to supply money to the real economy. Basic income means we don't have to do that anymore.\n\nYes, agreed.\n\n&gt; And that means we can allow the financial sector to shrink back to a more stable size, right?\n\nWhy shrink it? Let it go. Maybe it will shrink of its own accord. Why should our goal be to crowd out private investment? Crowding out implies zero-sum thinking but there can be enough freedom for both private investment and basic income to exist simultaneously.\n\n&gt; You said interest rates are a bad tool, but then you're saying we should use interest rate manipulation to make funding cheaper?\n\nThey should set repo rates and fed funds rates at 0%.\n\n&gt; I make it a point not to be philosophically opposed to things that promote human prosperity.\n\nInterest rates imply scarcity thinking. I don't charge interest when I lend money to someone, why should the Fed?\n\n&gt; It's fiscal expansion (more government spending) combined with monetary tightening (higher interest rates).\n\nI see.\n\nI guess I don't see the need for monetary tightening. I would let the financial sector wither away of its own accord, so I would simply have the Fed set rates at zero, and let markets price other tradeable assets off that rate.\n\n&gt; If we can lend to the government at a higher rate\n\nWhat stops finance firms for synthesizing Treasury-like instruments that promise an even higher rate? Traders make money on spreads. The spread is still there with higher Fed rates.\n\n&gt; If we use a basic income to fund consumer spending instead, then no more recessions.\n\nAgreed. \n\nThe point I disagree about is the need for higher rates and monetary tightening. The private sector will adapt and construct even higher rates to attract investment. You might be able to regulate private finance out of existence but I bet it would have unintended consequences. You would be restricting freedom, and philosophically that is bad. Finance firms see themselves as innovating. Why not let them innovate in their way without tightening monetary policy unnecessarily, but at the same time insure us against financial panics with basic income? The idea is to virtualize and sandbox financial markets, but voluntarily ...\n\nMain message: &gt; Since inflation is psychological, due to the arbitrariness of prices, high inflation does not mean the economy is out of capacity.\n\nWe can have inflation even when the economy has plenty of extra capacity.  This is true regardless of human psychology.\n\nLet's take inflation out of the discussion.  You want inflation.  I don't.  Whatever.  Let's talk about the *real* level of basic income that the economy can sustain.\n\n&gt; We can guard against unwanted effects of financial instability by ensuring that panics do not affect supply of money to the real economy.\n\nRight.  And the reason that panics affect the real economy is that we're using the unstable financial sector to supply money to the real economy.  Basic income means we don't have to do that anymore.\n\nAnd that means we can allow the financial sector to shrink back to a more stable size, right?\n\n&gt; Interest rates are a very bad tool.\n\nAre they a bad tool if our goal is to crowd out private investment?\n\n&gt; We should do what the Fed is now doing: print money to stabilize repo markets (set a below-market rate for funding, which is a kind of interest rate manipulation, but achieved by selling money at below market rates - i.e., heading down).\n\nWait a minute.  You said interest rates are a bad tool, but then you're saying we should use interest rate manipulation to make funding cheaper?\n\n&gt; The Fed is heading rates back towards zero. They should get them there, leave them there, and use other policies to maintain real purchasing power rather than nominal price stability.\n\nIf interest rates are zero, then that means the private financial sector is creating more of our money and a higher proportion of *real* consumer spending is being funded by the private financial sector, no?\n\nThe *real* amount of basic income is smaller than it would be at higher interest rates.\n\n&gt; &gt; I'm saying that basic income allows for monetary tightening.\n\n&gt; How is this basic income funded?\n\nThere's only one way to pay for a basic income: having an economy with the capacity for people to buy stuff with the money.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.greshm.org\/blog\/theres-only-one-way-to-pay-for-a-basic-income\/\n\n&gt; Deficit spending, monetized by the Fed?\n\nSure.  That's one way to print money.  From the perspective of the private economy, when the government deficit spends, it is *exactly equivalent* to the government printing money.\n\nFor example, if the government printed 4 quadrillion dollars and spent it into a hole in the ground, it would have zero effect on the economy.  If the government deficit spent 4 quadrillion dollars into the same hole, it would have the exact same effect.  The only difference is that the Fed's balance sheet would have expanded by 4 quadrillion dollars because they would have bought the treasuries that the government issued.\n\nAny time the government spends money *into* the economy, they're adding money to a part of the economy that didn't have it before.  It's all equivalent to printing money.\n\n&gt; That's expansion, even if you raised rates\n\nIt's fiscal expansion (more government spending) combined with monetary tightening (higher interest rates).\n\n&gt; which would have unforeseen effects like increasing mortgage rates.\n\nThat's not an unforeseen effect.  *Of course* UBI raises mortgage rates.\n\n&gt; I am philosophically opposed to interest rates above zero\n\nI make it a point not to be philosophically opposed to things that promote human prosperity.  Higher interest rates allow us to achieve a higher *real* basic income.\n\n&gt; the Fed should not charge for money whose supply curve is vertical.\n\nCharge for money?  Higher interest rates mean that the Fed is *paying* you more to give them money.\n\n&gt; Tl;dr: what is your funding source for basic income?\n\nIt doesn't matter.  The effect is the same regardless of where the money \"comes from.\"  What matters is whether the money has somewhere to go.  If you're having trouble with that answer, just call it printing money or deficit spending, whichever you prefer.  They're both the same.\n\n&gt; I might agree that letting market interest rates float naturally would be okay, if the Fed stopped lending money to banks altogether. \n\nThe Fed mostly isn't lending money to the banks.  They're *borrowing* money from the banks and paying interest.  The Fed sets interest rates through borrowing.\n\n&gt; But the government would have to prepare for situations where a liquidity shortage caused by higher \"natural\" rates spilled over into the real economy, causing privatized utilities to shut off power, etc.\n\nThe way you prepare is by having a basic income.  Basic income provides liquidity to the markets.  And you do the basic income *first*.  This is what makes it safe for us to allow interest rates to rise back up.\n\n&gt; the problem with \"natural\" rates is that they are fundamentally arbitrary and subject to panicky changes \n\nThere's no such thing as \"natural\" rates.  There are only higher rates and lower rates.  Basic income allows interest rates to be higher.\n\n&gt; spill over into the real economy causing unemployment and tight money for poor people.\n\nUnemployment is not a problem.  Lack of money is a problem.  Basic income solves this problem for us.  We've been incorrectly trying to solve this problem using jobs.\n\n&gt; The Fed can insure with a basic income, but higher rates alone will not end financial instability.\n\nYes they will.  The instability comes from speculative bubbles and a build-up of interconnected debt obligations that grow more brittle over time.  If we can lend to the government at a higher rate, then that reduces the amount of lending in the private financial sector.  No more speculative bubbles.  No more unstable build-up of private credit.\n\nThe business cycle and the credit cycle are a result of us trying to use the private financial sector to prop up consumer spending.  If we use a basic income to fund consumer spending instead, then no more recessions.",

Republicans run on the \u201csupply side\u201d doctrine of Milton Friedman in the Reaganomics era without paying attention to what Friedman said about the Negative Income Tax as a Demand Side to support the consumer\u2019s capacity to participate in the market. This has caused wealth distribution UP the wealth pyramid where assets are aggregated instead of in flow. Wealth inequality is not just dangerous from the bottom, but also creates instability all throughout the economy. When capital is not flowing, it freezes up like a glacier. Then investing strategies try to chase growth that isn\u2019t happening because demand is down due to the precarious situation of the people lower on the pyramid.\n\nSo now we got talk of \u201chelicopter money\u201d one-time stimulus grant of $1000 per adult in the US, but that may not act as intended.

IF there was a UBI and the jobs you referenced paid decent and realistic wages, benefits, etc, they'd have no problem filling the positions.  People want to get ahead.  Live in a nicer place, drive a better car, have money to vacation, and save for retirement.  Things like that.  \n\nI really don't think you'd have a problem finding a workforce doing the things that machines can't do and, more than likely, won't be able to do for decades to come.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people believe most people want a purpose in their life and don't want to sit around bored spouting bullshit on the internet.\n\nMain message: Sorry, I don't think I've made my position clear.

It's more that I'm not convinced there will be enough people willing to volunteer enough of their time, to match the same levels you see today.

    "text":"Comment response: It's probably a worthwhile exercise to separate ideology from behavior. \n\nCase in point: UBI is an idea that's generally treated as \"far left\". Like on a left-right scale where full-on communism is a -10 and zero-regulation capitalism is a +10, UBI probably falls somewhere between -7 and -9.  \n\nAt the same time, there are supporters of the idea who can calmly and rationally explain that our current trajectory has a foreseeable outcome where unskilled labor will become so devalued that there simply won't be enough consumption\/demand for every capable adult to be employed, and that our current approach of \"here's enough to not really get by, hopefully you find a job soon\" won't be sustainable when that happens. That's a \"far left\" idea presented in a very non-radical way.\n\nNow let's look at a mostly overlapping \"far left\" idea: $15 an hour minimum wage. That's not as far left as UBI - technically speaking a minimum wage that keeps up with inflation should be a zero on the ideology scale but realistically it's about a -3 in the modern climate. \n\nBut as it so happens, leading up to the 2018 election we had a schoolboard candidate in my area who was an incredibly solid candidate. His platform was generally the things you'd expect from a progressive schoolboard candidate: teaching what science says about evolution, supporting teachers, providing underperforming schools with more resources instead of less. And to be clear, he was the only left-of-center candidate running for this particular board seat. So when members of the progressive caucus grilled him on (and implied that they might not endorse him over) vocal support for a $15 minimum wage, that felt like a pretty radical tactic.\n\nSimilar differences in content vs presentation aren't hard to find: Tulsi Gabbard is practically a case study in the horseshoe effect where her tone and tactics - but not necessarily her substance - are so extreme that the messaging wouldn't seem entirely out of place in a MAGA sub. \n\nBy way of contrast, when someone like Elizabeth Warren presents a difficult problem that merits a \"radical\" solution that's and presents it with a rational argument, I have no problem with it. I wish moderates would better evaluate that type of problem-solving, and I wish more members of the \"far far left\" could do a better job of emulating her tone and approach.\n\nMain message: Far Far Left, A Discussion",

    "text":"Comment response: People actually like to work, if the work is meaningful and satisfying. Part of the reason why lockdowns had such an impact on mental health was because so many people didn't have anything to do. Sue, at first a lot of people would probably take the opportunity to take an extended (and probably needed) holiday and reassess their lives and priorities, but they should have the right to do that. Being forced to work long hours in an exhausting job steals people's right to self-determination. \n\nBear in mind that the proponents of UBI are generally arguing for the amount to be enough to live comfortably, if a person wanted to live more luxuriously, they would still have to work in some capacity in order to do so. \n\nThings that would probably change:\n\nPeople would work fewer hours, and have a better work-life balance, allowing them to spend more time on hobbies, family, etc. \n\nEmployers would have to provide drastically better working conditions - without wage slavery, they can no longer rely on people being desperate to earn money putting up with horrible treatment or of necessity. Employers would have to actually attract workers rather than exploit the most vulnerable people in society. \n\nAs a result, it would be much easier for people to take temporary breaks from work, or adjust their hours, based on their needs. This would have a huge impact on equality in society as it would mean that it works be much easier for disabled people to work, and women would not have to worry about keeping their job if they take time off for pregnancy or want to work fewer hours when their children are small. It would also be much easier for couples to share childcare responsibilities as maternity and paternity leave would no longer be something to fight for, employers would be forced to provide adequate arrangements or risk not being able to fill positions. \n\nIt's also very likely that workplaces would have to provide child care at work, allowing people to contribute without losing time during the most important stages of development. \n\nHaving parents around during the earliest years of life has a huge impact on development and wellbeing, with better life outcomes for children who have it than those who don't. \n\nQuality of life would drastically improve - without the constant stress of living paycheque to paycheque, or worrying about whether one can afford medications as well as food this month. \n\nWith a greater focus on work-life balance, people would have more time for the actual important things in life - spending time with friends and family, pursuing hobbies, self-development, education. \n\nThe number of available jobs would go up, as with shorter working hours, more people would be needed to cover them. Some people might choose to work only a few extra hours per week to give them something to do, others might want to do more in order to improve their income - but nobody would be forced to do either. \n\nPeople will pursue higher levels of education, as greater financial freedom means that they will not be forced to choose between education and work. Its a statistical certainty that individuals with the potential to be great scientists, engineers, artists or leaders have laboured in sweat shops and supermarkets because they never had the opportunity to discover or develop their talents. \n\nBecause people have the choice in what they do for a living, they will perform their jobs better. Higher productivity and innovation because people are doing what they want to do, and what suits their ability and interest. \n\nMassively reduced government spending. No more beaurocracy from welfare agencies, because everyone gets the same amount regardless - no medicare, unemployment, disability allowance; just one department making sure everyone gets their monthly stipend. People will no longer have to 'prove' their incapacity to work according to constantly moving goalposts - they will work or not, depending on what they are able or want to. \n\nThere will be some people who don't 'work' at all - maybe they will pursue a family, or make music, or play video games. But every penny they spend is still going to be taxed, and ultimately go back into the economy. Even now your average welfare recipient pays a greater proportion of tax than most businesses. \n\nBecause people's basic needs are met, there will be a reduction in crime, as fewer people will feel they have to steal in order to live. \n\nThe big thing with basic income is that its also needs other huge changes in the way governments treat their people. We'd need to reform prison, education and medical care pretty drastically. We'd also need to ramp up automation so that nobody has to do the really shitty jobs - or pay for those jobs would have to go up considerably. \n\nAnyway, it's Christmas morning and I've waffled enough. There are quite a lot of studies out there about human behaviour under basic income models. I can link to a few later if you like - I'm currently writing this on my phone so please excuse me for not providing them right now, but if you're interested I'd be more than happy to rustle some up for you later.\n\nMain message: &gt;\tSo yeah, I think if anyone doesn\u2019t want to work then the government should be compelled to pay them for the injustice of taking away every other option.\n\nI wonder something. Does letting people not have jobs and do just as well still have them keep those jobs? Or would they stop working",

Do you really think an attack an attack on fascists is an attack on you? If so that says a lot more about you than it does about me. \n\n&gt; No, fascist are not the only ones who believe this\n\nThat really doesn't matter, the whole point of propaganda is to have other people believe it. \n\n&gt; I'm a Canadian\n\nOk.\n\n&gt; who has one transexual friend\n\nGood for you.\n\n&gt; voted for Justin Trudeau\n\nOk.\n\n&gt; smokes weed\n\nblaze it.\n\n&gt; believes in equality for all\n\nWhich is what everyone says.\n\n&gt; have a Muslim friend\n\nGood for you.\n\n&gt; believe in same sex marriage\n\nAs does everyone. \n\n&gt; I'm a fascist according to you.\n\nNo. Again with the persecution complex.\n\n&gt; More identity politics, you just can't help yourself.\n\nThat's not identity politics, that's logic. It seems your idea of identity politics is anything that says we don't live in a perfectly equal utopia. There is no logical reason for someone to vote for Trump because some people criticize Sam Harris, especially since Sam Harris was doing the right thing and attacking Trump and disowning Trumpist followers. Logically, if there's are large group of Sam Harris voters, and a large group of them voted for Trump, and that large group swung the election, they would do so for other reasons than the ones you hypothesized. \n\n&gt; I hope you like Trump because he or a Trump like figure will get elected again because of this mindset you're using.\n\nYou don't have anything to actually back that up, no logic, no evidence, not even a good explantion. You don't speak for all Trump voters, or even the average Trump voter, you only state the reasons you might become a Trump voter. This is just cheap and passive aggressive on your part.\n\n&gt; I'm certain this is true to an extent but male, straight and white men are definitely being targeted as well.\n\nExcept their not, that's just propaganda as well as it's own form of identity politics that focuses on the dominant or majority groups being the victim when in fact they are still on top as a group. These kinds of beliefs are the reason fascism is coming back, it's just an incredibly extreme version of this kind of identity politics. \n\n&gt; implying Asian privilege will not get you anywhere but a one way ticket to being called a racist\n\nWell it is what white nationalists say, they say it because they want to be \"not racist\" toward at least one race and because it feeds into the idea that white men aren't on top anymore. Again, that's not you specifically, you're just repeating what they say. It's a red herring because Asians don't run the country, if you asked the average person on the street to describe the average Canadian they would say \"some Asian lady.\" To the degree that Asians do have high incomes and low crime statistics, it would probably come from the proportion of immigrants working in STEM fields as well as a lack of barriers to the middle class for children of immigrants. Also this would have started rather recent historically, within the past 40 years or so. If Asians don't experience prejudice that keeps them from being successful, then good, but I don't see what that has to do with other minorities being held back by bigotry. \n\n&gt; implying the same about a white male will make you feel virtuous, especially if you're a white male implying it about other white males because there is a level of self sacrifice \n\nAhh yes crap alt-right psycho-analysis. When you don't have arguments just chalk it up to some weakness or failing on the other side. I don't know what you would call that rant about being a pot smoking candian who has trans muslim friends and a UTI, but it seemed you were trying very hard to show how virtuous you were.  \n\n&gt; Interestingly enough less than 3% of American millionaires have inherited their wealth.\n\nThat's a bullshit statistic, 97% of American millionaires weren't born into poverty. First of all there is inflation, a million dollars isn't what it was during your dad's generation, a million dollar home got you a lot more house back in his day. And million dollar homes probably constitute a large portion of the wealth of those millionaires Second wealth inequality has exploded since your dad's generation, many of these millionaires come from upper middle class backgrounds where they did benefit from being born into those families. Statistically family wealth is a huge determinant in an individuals success.\n\n&gt; For example, Jordan Peterson (clinical psychologist) claiming that transexuality is a disorder or that you cannot change your sex.\n\nI hadn't actually heard that, I thought Jordan Peterson believed transexuality was a communist conspiracy and that he mixed Joseph Campbell and D&amp;D to justify being a stodgy old man. But hey, if you say he's a bigot I'm not going to disagree with you.\n\n&gt; if this implies it isn't a disorder but if you ask those same people if anorexia is a disorder they will likely claim that it is -- anorexia being another form of body dysphoria.\n\nThat's a rather nonsensical slippery slope argument, recognizing transgender people as not mentally ill won't lead to anorexia being made acceptable anymore than accepting gay people as not mentally ill didn't lead to the acceptance of pedophilia. The only difference is that you were younger and open minded when gay acceptance became mainstream, and you weren't at the age where these kinds of identity politics where the majority is the victim could work on you.  \n\n&gt; I agree that there are characters on both sides that put people into groups and right now you're behaving as one.\n\nOh the irony, you realize that your sentence is putting me in group, while you accuse me being someone who puts people into groups. And after having a carefully rehearsed and memorized diatribe about Asian privilege no less.\n\n&gt;  I'm on the left and people who act like you make it very hard for me to identify as such,\n\nSo you're not going to stand up for legal weed, Justin Trudeau, the rights and dignity of your muslim and trans friends, or UBI because of some random person on the internet saying we need to stop fascism? What does that say about you? It sounds like you need to rethink your priorities there. Again, you're holding an entire political ideology in contempt because of one guy, little old me who hasn't done anything wrong. In contrast I am on the left and all the time I run into lazy, complacent, self pitying whiners who think they are equally vicitimized by global corporatist capitalism, American imperialism, MTV news and Caitlyn Jenner being on the cover of Vanity Fair. None of these anti-solidary people have ever lessened my resolve or made me waiver in my principles.  \n\nMain message: &gt;Well yes, fascists will come up with any excuse for their existence, that doesn't make it true. Left wing identity politics isn't out to replace them and neither are the jews, but that doesn't stop them from believing that. \n \n\nPerfect example. Anyone who is of the opinion I posted is a fascist in your opinion. Someone disagreed with you, so you identified them with a certain group - Identity politics 101. No, fascist are not the only ones who believe this and I would say they would represent an extreme minority of those who believe this on the left and right. I'm a Canadian who has one transexual friend, voted for Justin Trudeau, smokes weed, believes in equality for all, have a Muslim friend (actually he is one of my references for jobs as well), believe in same sex marriage, UBI, etc but I'm a fascist according to you.\n\n&gt;Somehow I doubt that there is a large contingent of normal Sam Harris, Richard Dawkins and Bill Maher viewers who voted for Trump. To the extent there were, they viewed statements like that with simple minded bigoted literalist absolutism, in other words they were racist and viewed those criticisms as supporting their own bigotry.\n\nMore identity politics, you just can't help yourself. If they voted for Trump and were Harris fans they were only fans of theirs because those people gave arguments they believed justified their bigotry\/racism. I hope you like Trump because he or a Trump like figure will get elected again because of this mindset you're using.\n\n&gt; Trump also lost the popular vote to a uniquely unlikable and scandal ridden opponent and only came to power because of a few thousand votes in couple of states.\n\nMost definitely a key variable.\n\n\n&gt;That's not what is actually happening. What is happening is that fascist sympathizers are spreading the idea that left wing identity politics is an attack on white identity, on male identity and on straight identity, they also claim it's the equal and opposite of fascism, and responsible for the rise of fascism, all at once without contradiction. The message left is evil, powerful and responsible for everything wrong with the world while the right gets a pass.\n\nI'm certain this is true to an extent but male, straight and white men are definitely being targeted as well. Asians for example, get paid more money on average, get a better education, get arrested less and have higher rates of inherited wealth but implying Asian privilege will not get you anywhere but a one way ticket to being called a racist when implying the same about a white male will make you feel virtuous, especially if you're a white male implying it about other white males because there is a level of self sacrifice that people think they are committing. Interestingly enough less than 3% of American millionaires have inherited their wealth.\n\n\n&gt;They also create a troll culture where racism, sexism, homophobia and transphobia are acceptable, this normalizes bigotry far more than not at all common comparisons between Sam Harris and Richard Spencer.\n\nThere are opinions on these subjects that are entirely legitimate or illegitimate but one could innocently conclude that don't come from racism, homophobia, sexim transphobia, xenophobia, etc that will get you labeled as such. For example, Jordan Peterson (clinical psychologist) claiming that transexuality is a disorder or that you cannot change your sex. Those who claim he is transphobic will often cite the DSM and say it was recently changed to gender dysphoria as if this implies it isn't a disorder but if you ask those same people if anorexia is a disorder they will likely claim that it is -- anorexia being another form of body dysphoria.\n\n&gt;Unless Sam Harris is a mannequin and not the person making his podcast and posting on his twitter, that is unlikely to happen. The real Sam Harris is incredibly tribalistic and personally vindictive toward people who disagree with him publicly. He doesn't argue in good faith with critics and makes no attempts to actually express his ideas in ways that are much more difficult to misrepresent, instead he portrays all criticism as personal attacks or apologizing atrocities. But I understand where you are coming from and will insert a hypothetical reasonable person in his place.\n\nI'm a Harris fan so I often cite him as an example but if that bothers you there are plenty of other popular characters you can use instead.\n\n&gt;This is what I was alluding to earlier, for some reason a random person at UC Berkeley discredits the entire \"left\" but assholes like Baked Alaska who probably clubbed that person with a bat somehow don't represent the entire right. I'd recommend getting out of the Sargon, Tim Pool alt-lite bubble for a little while.\n\nI agree that there are characters on both sides that put people into groups and right now you're behaving as one. I'm on the left and people who act like you make it very hard for me to identify as such, not that I'm the type of person who cares about that but when it comes up in conversation, there is a part of me that wants to say \"Ah, well I'm left-sort of\".\n\nThanks for responding, I can't believe you read through that whole mess, sorry about that.\n\n   ",

    "text":"Comment response: It should, for the most part. I\u2019m sure some companies would like to keep certain market shares, and in cases of a near monopoly on the market they could easily pass more onto the consumer. Confused by your second question, you may be above my knowledge base on this, I\u2019m a math grad with a minor in risk management so I just learned about the \u201cwho really pay a tax\u201d thing in a lot of my finance courses.  \n\n\nThe article linked above about the 55% thing is using an aggregate of different commodity markets, hair dressers were one they used and sit down restaurants in France. I don\u2019t know the domination of chains in France, but I\u2019ll assume it\u2019s similar to the US, as well as hairdressers being more or less an upper middle to upper class commodity. Those people are probably going to continue to get their hair done regardless, and that\u2019s  supplanted with the evidence of them paying 79% of the VAT.  \n\nAnd, it\u2019s kind of further evidenced by [studies](https:\/\/www.taxpolicycenter.org\/briefing-book\/who-would-bear-burden-vat) that suggest when you supplement a VAT that exempts core essentials from the tax (food, medicine, healthcare) with cash payments, like UBI, you get lower inflation for the bottom 20% than you do the top 1%:\n\n&gt; better approach is to provide a limited cash payment\u2014that is, a demogrant or a refundable tax credit. That way, everyone receives the same benefit, in dollars, which translates into a larger share of low-income households\u2019 income.\n\n&gt; In the same study, Toder, Nunns, and Rosenberg simulate the effects of a 7.7 percent broad-based VAT with a refundable tax credit (the higher tax rate keeps the net revenues the same as the 5 percent, broad-based VAT with no tax credit). They find that the VAT in combination with the tax credit would impose an average tax burden of 0.6 percent on households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. Households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would face an average tax burden of 3.6 percent. Their results also show that the distribution of a narrow-based VAT that excludes spending on food, housing, and health care is much the same as the distribution of a broad-based tax (table 1).  \n\n\nAdmittedly, if it\u2019s a flat VAT on everything then the poor will be disadvantaged more, but, according to Yang\u2019s website:\n\n&gt; This VAT would vary based on the good to which it\u2019s applied, with staples having a lower rate or being excluded, and luxury goods having a higher rate.\n\nHe\u2019s trying to only focus on low elasticity of demand products (ie customers who might complain about an increase but are still gonna buy it) and hit luxury goods. So while averages in other places is important, it\u2019s also the type of consumer being modeled in that aggregate. They are people who can afford sit down restraints, hair dressers, and other goods that the bottom 20% of the country can\u2019t afford, and won\u2019t be seeing much of an increase in a limited, narrow VAT in conjunction with UBI.\n\n**edit:** hope I get this in before you respond. I notice you claim that people who get more than 1K in benefits will be hurt regardless, but the study I\u2019ve linked implies it will be a less than 1% increase in tax burden. It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s definitely not a lot.\n\nMain message: Your elasticity arguments should hold whether inflation is VAT-driven or not, right? Are you observing particularly low inflation rates on goods consumed by lower income individuals?",

It wouldn't have been a 'true' UBI but rather income guaranteed to people below the poverty line to keep them out of poverty (which is still fairly good). They did lots of testing on the idea and it worked fantastically. \n\nAn advisor of the president who was a Randian libertarian type wrote a report casting an 18th century attempt at something like UBI (essentially a form of fuedal poor laws\/ alms) that ended in a peasant revolt as decisive evidence against a UBI. But most of the scholarship around Speenhamland until quite recently was not great, so a lot of observers drew very wrong conclusions. \n\nEventually it was buried in the Senate as a lot of very spurious things were said about a UBI that didn't really match up with the actual data. It was killed nevertheless. \n\n\nIt's a great example of how recent welfare being a significant left-right issue is. Until more or less the 70's-80's when the US and the Uk started really gutting welfare it was more of a question of how much than whether to have a useful benefits system. Having a robust welfare state makes a lot of sense for the same reasons having state schools, roads and hospitals does and it's a shame that it's become a partisan issue in the way it has. It's extraordinary how we got from Nixon almost creating a UBI to Clinton gutting welfare.\n\nMain message: Curious. Tell more.",

I like the section under the header \"Neoliberal in Practice?\" and the following quote in particular: \"Indeed, if basic income is abandoned to the technocrats we will be sure to get a tepid or even regressive set of social policies; **a desirable, radical version will find many opponents, in particular employers, and will require massive popular mobilization.**\" The bolded part stood out to me in particular, and it made me realize that if UBI were to be implemented, the ONLY candidate in this election cycle who I would trust to implement a progressive version of UBI that empowers the working class and poor, should he so choose to, is no other than Bernie Sanders. Since he's not proposing UBI, then I'm not trusting anyone else, because nobody else is talking about a political revolution that will find many opponents in the ruling class.\n\nMain message: IMO: the difference between democratic socialism and \"human-centered capitalism\"",

    "text":"Comment response: &gt; I have discussed this with HE3 before, and we just plain disagree.\n\nFirst of all, I can't speak on behalf of HE3, but I'm fairly certain he doesn't believe a UBI would be bad, just that it won't be as effective as an NIT. Additionally, if you \"just plain disagree,\" with what he is saying on this topic, that's because you are making 0 real effort to understand what he is saying as it does not confirm your priors.\n\nSecondly, did you even read the economist you linked? He's not saying a UBI is superior to a NIT, instead he is saying opponents have not accurately taken into account the affects of replacing welfare with such systems and overstate their unemployment effects.\n\nI don't know of economists who support a UBI, but I imagine there are some. But there are also economists who are Marxists, so who cares? I haven't read a literature review or done what I would call extensive research on it, but the majority of the literature seems to indicate a UBI has a larger unemployment effect than the NIT and is not overall as optimal.\n\nHE3 is pretty much stating [consensus\n](http:\/\/www.igmchicago.org\/igm-economic-experts-panel\/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_eKbRnXZWx3jSRBb) at the moment.\n\nWhen you start working backwards by digging for economists (who you think support UBI over NIT), you are only confirming your bias, lying to yourself and behaving entirely unscientific. Actually review the literature yourself and heed what those who know more than you are saying here and elsewhere.\n\n&gt; Again, the reason I prefer UBI is that I believe something that applies to everyone is more likely to be seen as a right. I see NIT only being seen as a program, not a right, and I see it being seen similar to welfare, where it's a matter of makers vs. takers instead of all being treated equally.\n\nSo you prefer UBI for normative reasons? That's fine and something I am sympathetic to, but it's not economics, that's for sure. \n\n&gt; I also see UBI as far more efficient to calculate, which it is because there's no calculation.\n\nAdministrative overhead differences between UBI and NIT are negligible and it's unclear if a UBI even saves money in that regards.\n\nAnother qualm of mine in regards to the UBI, is the fact it is distributed universally. Do you really think rich people need to be handed more money, when it could be going to the poor instead?\n\nThat snapshot of a chart doesn't capture a ton of data and is extremely misleading. It's true televisions, phones etc have plummeted in cost and increased in quality, but so has everything else, maybe not as evidently in the past decade or ever, but it's still true. I don't think I could properly address it without knowing the source or methodology, but I can guarantee it's using the CPI (which is misleading for everyone who doesn't happen to be wealthy and live in a city) and is looking at a select basket of goods over the incredibly short run. \n\nAdditionally, the sticker price of college has been relatively unchanged while its quality has improved dramatically. Colleges got really good at price discrimination while their teachers and tech they provided also improved. Healthcare is a similar story to colleges, except much of the gains have come from a massive improvement in technology that now the rest of the world outside of the U.S. is beginning to experience.\n\n&gt;I see the total costs of food and housing basically not budging this century \n\nMaybe because the massive [decrease in food prices](http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/btn\/volume-2\/average-food-prices-a-snapshot-of-how-much-has-changed-over-a-century.htm) has already occurred. Meanwhile, housing costs have clearly decreased after adjusting for household size and square footage. Go figure, fewer people living in bigger houses makes the price looks like it's increasing much more than what it is.\n\n&gt; I also see an economy increasingly leaving middle and low income consumers behind, instead focusing on the upper quintile because that's where the money is, and I don't see that as being sustainable, economically or socially.\n\nThe skill biased technological change is real and I think it would be accurate to say in the future there will be a lot more people (in real numbers and %) making a lot more money and inequality will be greater than overall today. However, that's not as much of an issue because nobody is getting rich at the expense of another because wealth is not a zero sum game.\n\nAdditionally, although it is hard to say what the future holds, it does seem like the median quintile in particular will stagnate, although historically compensation has more or less tracked with compensation.\n\nOkay now listen up, because this is seriously probably the most important thing I am going to say so far. Your people will soon be going the way of the horse assertions are crazy and by far the worst of your arguments. \n\nIf you really want a better way of understanding the role technology and its improvements play, read brilliant [MIT economist David Autor](http:\/\/economics.mit.edu\/files\/9835). His work is widely cited in this specific subject and he is likely the foremost expert we have. \n\nMy main concerns are ultimately your case for UBI is based in a fictitious narrative and you aren't thinking of it in terms of purely alleviating poverty. Meanwhile, you're ignoring the research we have on NIT for ideological reasons. Lastly, because of the fictitious forecast you have in your head, you lack an understanding of what seems to be a real concern we will have in the future, the SBTC.\n\nI'm also personally a bit partial to [Tyler Cowen](http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Average-Is-Over-Powering-Stagnation\/dp\/0142181110) in this area, but I can understand if he's not everyone's cup of tea (and I don't think he has as great an understanding as Autor).\n\nMain message: I have discussed this with HE3 before, and we just plain disagree. He's not the only economist in existence and there are others that disagree with him, as disagreement is something economists are wont to do. Here's [one of them](http:\/\/www.economonitor.com\/dolanecon\/2014\/08\/25\/a-universal-basic-income-and-work-incentives-part-2-evidence\/).\n\nNIT has been tried and UBI has been tried. Both show positive effects. I disagree that NIT is good and UBI is bad as HE3 constantly insists despite the evidence in Namibia, India, and Alaska, which of course he says doesn't apply as evidence. There's also unconditional cash transfer evidence from all over, which I'm sure he also believes doesn't apply.\n\nBoth NIT and UBI are forms of basic income and therefore I support both. The evidence for both is greatly positive. Again, the reason I prefer UBI is that I believe something that applies to everyone is more likely to be seen as a right. I see NIT only being seen as a program, not a right, and I see it being seen similar to welfare, where it's a matter of makers vs. takers instead of all being treated equally. I also see UBI as far more efficient to calculate, which it is because there's no calculation. It's just distributed. As long as there's calculation there will be gaps people can fall through.\n\nThere's a lot to discuss here and I just find it unfortunate that for the most part this sub shows little interest in discussing it.\n\nAs for the concerns being baseless in reality. What do you see when you look at this?\n\nhttp:\/\/i.imgur.com\/RR4H0A2.png\n\nI see the total costs of food and housing basically not budging this century, despite tech having an obvious effect in lowering a lot of prices, but at the same time not affecting expenses that continue to get more expensive like education, childcare, and healthcare. So when I look another 10 or 20 years down the road, I don't expect everything to be lower in price then either. Plenty will be, yes, but enough so that people don't need to worry about income? I don't think so.\n\nI also see an economy increasingly leaving middle and low income consumers behind, instead focusing on the upper quintile because that's where the money is, and I don't see that as being sustainable, economically or socially.",

So maybe the tool you need is initially pretty expensive, but is buying and maintaining that tool going to be cheaper than paying for the salary and benefits of 9 entire people? Even if it isn't initially, technology gets cheaper over time and it *will* eventually tilt in favor of the tool. This is how coal mining has seen an immense downturn in jobs despite so much of our mining happening domestically, because now you can mine an entire mountainside with just a dozen or people in a year while 200 years ago a mining operation on that scale could sustain an entire town for a generation. What do we do with all those people that lost those jobs? What happens as more and more industries move in this direction? \n\nIt's true that the effects of automation are inflated as they are currently. But they are incredibly important still to keep in mind as we move our economy into the next stage of humanity. Things like universal basic income are going to become a conversation that is mandatory within our lifetimes due to factors like this.\n\nMain message: Not really - most automation allows workers to do the same job but more efficiently. If automation just replaced jobs, then the industrial revolution would have permanently destroyed the economy.  \n\nThe problem is a few greedy people who are caught between refusing to pay the high wages expected in Western countries, and offshoring all industry, but then leaving the West (and their main customer base) penniless.",

Agricultural employers found that prospective employees didn\u2019t even show up for interviews. The hospitality industry reported the same phenomenon . A recent survey by the Business Development Bank of Canada of 1,251 small and medium-sized businesses found that 55 per cent are struggling to hire the workers they need, hampering growth and forcing businesses to delay or refuse new orders.\n\nThere is no shortage of workers. If you paid workers better, treated them with dignity and respect, and provided them with a health workplace, they would work for you perhaps.  \n\n\n&gt; In the words of one frustrated employer currently offering employees 65 per cent more than the minimum wage, \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to work, especially in agriculture or physical labour-based jobs.\u201d He added, \u201cIf UBI (universal basic income) comes into effect, agriculture will be a dead business.\u201d\n\nLol is the boss good? Or do they treat their employees well and provide them a good workplace? If not then perhaps they should rethink their strategy.  \n\n\n&gt;If anything, CERB and CRB were a perfect test case about why a UBI is an idea whose time has not come. Apart from the price tag of a universal income, which the Parliamentary Budget Officer pegged at $85 billion in 2021\u201322, rising to $93 billion in 2025\u201326, starting one now would hamper economic growth at the very time when that growth is sorely needed. UBI supporters may retort that employers should simply pay workers more, but without growth, it\u2019s hard to see where those bigger paycheques will magically come from.\n\nNot a proponent of UBI, but if employers want workers, they should pay them living wages. No employer is entitled to, nor has the right to, wage slaves.\n\nMain message: Tasha Kheiriddin: CERB problems are bad news for proponents of a guaranteed basic income",

It seems like everyone who talks about it is just \"We need it!\" But nobody actually talks about how we could implement it except \"give everyone some money and it'll help the economy good!\"",

In many firms however there is a bias that weeds out applicants without 4 year degree, personal connections or relevant experience.\n\nI suspect we would benefit from some sort of national retraining \/ reskilling program. Certainly neither 2.8 trillion\/year UBI welfare state nor $1-2 trillion\/yr \"green new deal\" that incentivizes soon-to-be-obsolete manufacturing jobs will solve this problem.\n\nAny human who wants a job in the next 10 years simply needs to figure out how to provide the services businesses and customers will be eager to pay for.\n\nWe did more preparing for the shift from agricultural to manufacturing economy than what we have done to prepare for shift to rapidly changing tech and services economy. Around the turn of the previous century many states extended mandatory public school education to age 16. The result gave our workforce an edge compared to other countries.\n\nMy dream scenario would be something along the lines of national 1-2 year internship\/apprenticeship program (maybe extend high school another year or two), where participants learn on the job how to actually perform the daily work, specifically jobs that aren't likely to be handled by automation in 10 years. \n\nThis kind of thing can only succeed if private sector buys in to fund the program and also train and hire these people. Ideally employers that opt-in to participate cover most of the cost and establish alternate recruiting path instead of prerequisite 4-year degree. \n\nObviously some positions will always require advanced degree or special licenses etc, but I feel in most cases the 4-year degree is not relevant, just an arbitrary detail so HR managers can reduce the resume slush pile\n\nMain message: &gt;  I wonder if we would benefit from some new reskilling and recruitment path bypassing university degrees and student debt altogether.  \n\nThey call that trade schools, or apprenticeships.  \n\nMy brother is a high school principal.  He had a representative from a pipefitter's union ask to set up an information table at their college information events, he's offering paid training and if you make it through the two year apprenticeship program you can be making $50K in most cities in the US - and if you go for some of the harder certifications you can be making six figures within a couple of years.",

A somewhat better question is where do the resources come from? Well, there are two parts. First, even resources aren't strictly conserved - the economy is an engine for turning human time, energy and thought into resources. UBI moves resources from less efficient places to more efficient places, accelerating that process.

    "text":"Comment response: &gt;You're wrong. Assigning an arbitrary amount to the labor does increase it's value, just not to the business.\n\nWhat?!? The value to the business is what determines whether the business can stay in business! The value to the business *is the thing that matters*, because no business=no job. \n\n&gt; A comfortable life? When you raise the floor, the ceiling moves with it. Raising the minimum wage does not remove opportunity to build a career or improve your economic standing.\n\nIt removes the *motivation*. Thanks to your arbitrary \"living wage\" (not merely \"raising the minimum wage,\" but providing what you yourself called a wage that removes people from poverty) they already make enough  to get by above the poverty line.\n\n&gt; Which businesses can't afford it? I made less money than McDonald's and Walmart running my business and still paid more than twice the minimum wage, AND I was exempt from minimum wage laws! This is a false argument. Costco posted record profits paying $15 per hour.\n\nDo you have any idea how many small businesses there are out there? Your example of your business is meaningless without context. Do you think all businesses are Costco?  \n\n&gt;Trained chimps and machines don't pay taxes. People do. It's in the government's best economical interest to keep people gainfully employed; especially burger flippers as they routinely spend more than 100% of their earnings. Every job replaced by a machine is a step closer to a Guaranteed Basic Income which should scare the Libertarian inside y'all.\n\nOh good, that tripe. I'm not scared of GBI, because it will NEVER happen. It's an economic nightmare, and not one of its proponents can actually say how to pay for it in any coherent fashion. But you didn't really respond to my point, which is that you must have a skill worth more to an employer. I didn't ask about the government and taxes. \n\nWhat's really funny is that you can't do math. Those taxes that the burger flippers are supposedly paying? They came *from the employers*. The money that the government is taxing doesn't magically manifest out of thin air. You're moving water from one bucket to another (one with holes in it) and thinking you have more water. \n\n&gt; Happy employees reduce turnover rate, decrease training costs, and increase production.\n\nDo they increase production 100%? If I raise a worker's pay from $7.50 to $15, do I get twice the work out him? If that's the case, why not raise his salary to $45 and get three times the work out of him. Hell, you claimed you payed double... so why didn't you pay triple? Think of how efficient your employees would have been if they were making $23 an hour? Or think of the amazing work you could have gotten out of them at $30 an hour! 4X increased production!\n\n&gt; I do agree, though. Learn a trade. It will only make your life better. But in the meantime, continue to champion the lowest paid among us. When they do better, we do better.\n\nIt costs you nothing to \"champion\" that. You aren't the one being forced to pay that wage whether your business can afford to do so or not. You aren't the one having to hire fewer workers, cut benefits, work them harder, or raise your prices. You get to go on Reddit and pretend to be a champion of the poor. \n\n\nMain message: \"It is not the purpose of business to provide a \"living wage.\" It is the purpose of a business to make a profit. Assigning an arbitrary amount to labor doesn't make that labor more valuable.\"\n\nYou're wrong. Assigning an arbitrary amount to the labor does increase it's value, just not to the business. \n\n\"Why would you? if you can make a \"living wage\" flipping burgers what incentive is there to further education?\"\n\nA comfortable life? When you raise the floor, the ceiling moves with it. Raising the minimum wage does not remove opportunity to build a career or improve your economic standing. \n\n\"Ah, so businesses that can't afford your arbitrary wage will cease to exist. So where do all these \"living wage\" jobs come from? Who provides them?\"\n\nWhich businesses can't afford it? I made less money than McDonald's and Walmart running my business and still paid more than twice the minimum wage, AND I was exempt from minimum wage laws! This is a false argument. Costco posted record profits paying $15 per hour. \n\n\"Why? Because you don't like it? As \/u\/George26er pointed out, it's a voluntary agreement. Don't want to get paid minimum wage? Find a job that pays better. Ah, but here's the catch: you must have something worth more to an employer. A trained chimp can flip burgers or bus tables. \"\n\nTrained chimps and machines don't pay taxes. People do. It's in the government's best economical interest to keep people gainfully employed; especially burger flippers as they routinely spend more than 100% of their earnings.  Every job replaced by a machine is a step closer to a Guaranteed Basic Income which should scare the Libertarian inside y'all. \n\n\n\"I don't care whether they're \"happy\" or not. Get some skills, learn a trade, do something that makes you more valuable to an employer. If you won't then enjoy bagging fries for minimum wage. Because you're not entitled to anything more than you agreed to be paid.\"\n\nHappy employees reduce turnover rate, decrease training costs, and increase production.\n\nI do agree, though. Learn a trade. It will only make your life better. But in the meantime, continue to champion the lowest paid among us. When they do better, we do better.\n\n\n",

Does everyone deserve a single detached home close to downtown? Definitely not.\n\nWhat about a small condo 1 unit? Do they deserve to be able to afford a unit right in the core of downtown?

Regarding automation, I really don't know what path it will take, but I rather think we'll continue to see incremental changes rather than anything that completely revolutionizes society in one major go.\n\nStill, I believe that we're going to see some profound changes in the coming years, regardless of technology - and that every decade will introduce potentially massive disruption that we couldn't predict now.  Just for example, very few people would have seen the negative impact of social media on society 10, 20 years ago. \n\nI think that's where we differ in approach - if I understand you correctly, you are in favor of a mix of very fundamental (philosophy, logic) educational tools and directly relevant hands-on education (e.g. how to use computers), while I see the need for more and better teaching on the basic how-to understanding of how societies and economies work (hence civics, economics, history).\n\nI do hope though that we are able to sort out the much more immediate issue of how uneducated idiots are easily manipulated into screwing up our democratic processes very fundamentally, and soon.\n\nMain message: Doesn't need to be automated entirely;  when decent enough living can be created on a large enough scale with, say, fewer than 10 years work on the part of any one individual, we'll have made it close enough that the rest is just sizing to scale.\n\nI think a century for complete automation is attainable. I think 30 years for automation sufficient to cover basic needs for smaller groups of people isn't terribly unreasonable (Think the uber-rich, or, potentially, retirement communities where the people can be fed, clothed, and housed with fewer and fewer external resources, for examples of things kinda in the works).\n\nThere was a project underway to get an entire 65+ community set up with Farmbots for each household, to help reduce food costs and help improve food security and health.  Wish they'd set up a damn page so I could link them.  But it's projects like that (which, even ignoring their optimistic repayment timetable, does look like it'd save money within ten years at the worst) which may pave the way.\n\nAnd technological progress such as Self-Driving Vehicles paving the way for Personal Rapid Transit in such small communities, and...\n\nI think you're aware of the tech out there; I think you believe we need a much higher threshhold to start changing things than I do.",
