I don't think that I do.  There are basically 3 tracks for young people:

**(1) The climbers**
These people go to university and get a highly employable degree.  They are driven and have high lifetime earning potential in fulfilling careers and so have a strong incentive to build those skills.  They are willing to work for very little  or no money in the short-run (internships) to get themselves into the middle or upper middle class down the road.

*UBI: helps them bridge into their careers because education and internships cost so much, but then hurts them because they earn lots of money*

**(2) The wanderers**
These people go to university and get a marginally employable degree.  They lack employable skills right out of university and either work a variety of low-skill jobs or go back for a more focused education in their mid-20s (nursing, teaching, etc.).  These people are having a hard time because they lack money, but also because their lives are falling short of expectations.  Most are sufficiently ambitious and for the most part they will work hard and not rely on UBI.  Eventually, by working long enough at various jobs or by getting focused educations, they are able to make it into the middle class.

*UBI: helps them maintain their standard of living while they build skills and networks to boost their earning potential.  Pushes some people out of the skill-building track and into group (3)...*

**(3) The blighted**
These people didn't go to university.  They lack employable skills and can only get jobs that pay close to minimum wage.  These jobs aren't great but you do build skills slowly.  Those skills may set you up down the road for something better, but it's a grind.  Basically these people are on the same track as the wanderers but the earnings curve is shifted way down.  The problem is that these people at age 20 may conclude that they can work for a pittance and by the time they are 30 have sufficient skills to earn a decent living, or just call it quits and live on the UBI.  I think lots of them would, and would continue to live on it indefinitely.

*UBI: provides a strong incentive to stop working.  Helps a lot in the short run, hurts a lot in the long run.*

The actual answer is: raise the minimum wage, expand the EITC, government jobs, etc. to give everyone, but especially (3), a chance to work for decent money.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It would force politicians to take responsibility for such provisions whenever we intervene in other countries.

20,"The two common ones I’ve heard have very different goals depending on if it’s a left or right leaning policy.\n\nOne is adjustment of income tax bands to essentially increase the taxes of the working population by the same amount as they would receive under UBI, so those working remain net neutral in terms of income and government expenditure isn’t increased for them. Current social welfare programs are then scrapped and their funding is used pay for those receiving UBI but are currently on social welfare. The objective being everyone essentially stays at the current income levels and government net expenditure doesn’t change. The theoretical benefit here the removal of the administrative overhead inherent in social welfare and reducing the social stigma of receiving it.\n\nThe second approach I’ve seen is more common in right wing proponents of UBI. Essentially remove all services, health, education, social welfare and state pensions and replace with private institutions but don’t increase tax (or pair with a flat tax).This approach has a lot more issue than the first. Without a change to tax’s on the working, everybody receiving a higher income leads to a huge boost to inflation effectively reducing the purchasing power of those on social income without explicitly cutting the income they receive. It also exponentially increases the cost of the program. Even with cutting all services, by not adjusting tax the scheme would be no where near fully funded and this would be used to justify reducing UBI levels thereby cutting the entire social security system with one change. The privatization of services also leads to increasing private profits on services. Those on UBI would then have to pay private companies for services previously received for free but on income level that are worth less than they were previously on. \n\nThe first is a balanced, viable and reasonable approach the second is a capitalists wet dream.","['Taxes', 'Non-UBI government welfare programs', 'Public services and healthcare']",ffln2kv,I have never seen a solid argument of were the money for UBI would come from,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

[This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/g3kdir/andrew_yang_proposes_2000_monthly_stimulus_warns/fnt4j7p) (in support of it) summarizes that plan. 

It involves **removing most welfare**  which would save taxpayers 1.03 trillion dollars [[1](https://www.budget.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CRS%20Report%20-%20Welfare%20Spending%20The%20Largest%20Item%20In%20The%20Federal%20Budget.pdf) ]

Yang’s second way of paying for UBI would be through a VAT or a Value added tax. A value added tax would take a percentage of a good’s value in a tax at each stage of the production process (**which would massively increase production cost and the costs of products**). 

He says:

&gt;A well constructed VAT tax could net the government anywhere from $800 billion to $1.3 trillion depending on the % taxed. [[4](http://www.crfb.org/blogs/would-10-vat-pay-1000-month-ubi) ]. 
&gt;
&gt;So if we add the $1 trillion created from eliminating welfare and the $1 trillion average collected from a VAT, we are looking at $2 trillion total. If we pay every American adult $1000 a month or 12k a year, this would come out to be $2.5 trillion dollars. (209,000,000 x 12000 ≈ 2.5 trillion) 

So if we remove all welfare and cause all productions to be much more expensive, we're almost half way there.",0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Have you tried asking? From [his website](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/):

&gt;It would be easier than you might think. Andrew proposes funding UBI by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 10%. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally – most would prefer cash with no restriction.

&gt;A Value-Added Tax (VAT) is a tax on the production of goods or services a business produces. It is a fair tax and it makes it much harder for large corporations, who are experts at hiding profits and income, to avoid paying their fair share. A VAT is nothing new. 160 out of 193 countries in the world already have a Value-Added Tax or something similar, including all of Europe which has an average VAT of 20 percent.

&gt;The means to pay for a Universal Basic Income will come from 4 sources:

&gt;1.  Current spending.  We currently spend between $500 and $600 billion a year on welfare programs, food stamps, disability and the like.  This reduces the cost of Universal Basic Income because people already receiving benefits would have a choice but would be ineligible to receive the full $1,000 in addition to current benefits.

&gt;2.  A VAT.  Our economy is now incredibly vast at $19 trillion, up $4 trillion in the last 10 years alone.  A VAT at half the European level would generate $800 billion in new revenue.  A VAT will become more and more important as technology improves because you cannot collect income tax from robots or software.

&gt;3.  New revenue.  Putting money into the hands of American consumers would grow the economy.  The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy would grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs.  This would generate approximately $500 – 600 billion in new revenue from economic growth and activity.

&gt;4.  We currently spend over one trillion dollars on health care, incarceration, homelessness services and the like.  We would save $100 – 200 billion as people would take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional.  Universal Basic Income would pay for itself by helping people avoid our institutions, which is when our costs shoot up.  Some studies have shown that $1 to a poor parent will result in as much as $7 in cost-savings and economic growth.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Someone had mentioned that this isn't true UBI because of the small dollar amount and lack of sustainability, and they are technically right if you’re envisioning a comprehensive UBI model. It's a demonstration to see what potential impact a small supplemental, no questions asked amount of funds can have in the lives of those who are experiencing severe generational poverty. Hence the name Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED). Stockton is a good place to try this out because to some degree it’s a demographic microcosm of the U.S. in many respects (for race, religion, political affiliation, etc.).

Some have asked what kind of difference $500 can make or if it can truly create any significant impact in someone’s life. Some areas of our town, specifically parts of South Stockton, have an economic profile more fitting of a developing country. Census tract info will show you areas where the median income floats around 30k, life expectancy of 65, adult high school graduation rates of 60%, etc. The area has been disinvested since the era of the New Deal, which fortunately is starting to change now because of the work the Mayor has set in motion. So when you consider $500 it’s important to keep in mind the community it’s going in to and where those folks are at both economically and in potential opportunity.

There's a lot of buzz around this due to its novelty and uniqueness, but in truth we're still figuring out what this is going to look like and what we would like to learn from it. The ideas discussed in this article paint the general plan, but the details are still being determined. It's a rare opportunity, and we're taking our time to do it right and ensure that both the city and the project funders get some meaningful insight out of the demonstration.

We aren’t really the first considering other similar projects in the U.S., but each of those projects is different. Regardless, it's exciting stuff without a doubt!

  The issue I take with your tax argument is that the government will have to print the very money they are taxing.  If money is their incentive to allow the squeeze, then why don't they just print money whenever they need it?  Right - because inflation would run rampant.  
  But inflation is only a problem when the printed money stays in the hands of the wealthy elite who hoard it right?  Surely if  inflation occurs as part of a wealth transfer to the common man, then its effects will be mitigated?Maybe.  But if printing money to hand out to the common man, or even just those in desperate need had no downsides, why was the Fed so stingy with stimulus during one of the most financially desperate times our nation has faced with the pandemic?  Also, why not implement a universal basic income on some scale?  Because the money always has to come from somewhere.  There's a reason the Fed implements taxes to pay for programs like these rather than just printing it.


Regarding confidence in the US markets - The whole world is watching and our government wouldn't dare strip away our facade of a free market by ""forgiving"" all the naked shorts and reveal to other countries that its really the wealthy elite who control our market.  Right?
My problem with this response is that if an economic collapse really is the outcome of the Fed printing trillions cover the hedgefunds who can't cover their own shorts, then the gov't may decide there is a point at which the damage from other countries pulling out of our market will be less than the damage caused by hyperinflation (just look at what hyperinflation did to Venezuala).

In fact, expect it to fail. Treat it similar to how SpaceX treated the recent Starship test launch. After it crashed, when it tried to land, many called it a relatively successful test. 

Instead of focusing on having a successful initial UBI, focus on getting important relevant data from a large scale, but minimal amount, test UBI. After collecting data, look for ways to implement a better UBI. Then, scale up successive UBI tests from there.

For example, we could consider the direct payments from the first round of pandemic relief as a quick and dirty prototype UBI. How did it go? What does the data reveal? Personally, I know several people who work and pay taxes, but they didn't receive a payment. Why? Not because the IRS does not know their address. The IRS sends them collection notices. They did not receive a check, because they owe back taxes. Their poverty level income leaves them feeling too poor to file their tax returns. Plus, the ones who live in a state that has income taxes likely owe back taxes to their state too. So, the state government can intercept payments from the federal government. I don't understand all of the details, but I have heard that can happen. I have even heard that a state can even intercept social security payments. 

So, how can a direct payment UBI accomplish the goal of assisting the most impoverished, when they can't even collect the full amount of a UBI payment from the start? Either it may not arrive at all, or it may get garnished to pay off back taxes or some other debts. 

Maybe, to implement a successful UBI, it will require protecting that income from taxation, including paying back taxes. It might also require protecting that income from garnishment of all kinds. Why? Many people in the current economy live on incomes generated by doing work that pays in cash. I wonder how many people currently living below the poverty level actually file tax returns.

And MANY people who favor a left UBI that does NOT dismantle the social safety net are totally fine with the UBI not stacking with other welfare programs like food stamps and tanf, so we can transition people who need that help to something less shitty and restrictive, if they WANT the chains taken off.

READ

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/01/month-no-strings-attached/

Read what happens with that UBI that stacks with other programs, the thousand dollars extra a month is treated like additional wage income, and you STILL get reductions in other benefits.  That is what a higher minimum wage and higher paying federal jobs will ALREADY DO, you make more, you get less with the conditions.  And in conservative states, you are at the mercy of draconian conditions and hoops to get assistance in the first place.

Why are you so dead set on that being the ONLY option to help people?  Yangs UBI leaves that system there, but offers another booster without the strings.  A booster that does not shrivel up with making more money, or going over a time limit.  Many people on welfare who do start making more money that used to be better off taking the welfare, could later switch to the UBI, the poor are VASTLY better off with that option, but you don't like it? 

What a pampered little prick you must be, you have ZERO clue how low to the ground people live that you would so easily swat away this aide because it was not structured in the way Brooks decided was the ONLY proper way. 

Free reign to automate? companies have that reign now, go watch American Factory on netflix, you think the impulse to sidestep automation is going to be staved off by a higher minimum wage?  A jobs guarantee at least offers some paid labor as a different track, though eventually you will end up with bullshit jobs if you just guarantee some terrible employee who works 20 times slower than the average is kept around because of this stupid sense that one must WORK to be afforded the basics to live.  You have the same soul as conservatives with that demand, just to a lesser degree.

Right now Americans are cut out of the economic loop with increase automation, UBI puts them back in.

And I'm not engaging? fucking please, I'm swatting away lies left and right because you dumb hicks who swallow whatever slobber Brooks drools out keep reinforcing his hit jobs.  

I'm in YOUR territory now in the majority report sub, why don't you venture out and see how far you get with this drivel.

If Brooks advocates for local political issues, great, he needs to stop blaming national policies to lift the poor higher, like UBI, on LOCAL failures to deal with housing cost issues.  I KNOW he's done that and he needs to stop directing blame to the wrong sources.  Like I've said before, if wages continued to track with productivity since the 70s when they began to diverge, the median wage in the US would be HIGHER per capita than the current proposals for a 12k a year UBI.

So merely putting more resources into the hands of people, via a UBI, or labor, is not going to solve local housing issues.  That problem does not arise because of UBI, or the absence of UBI, it can be made worse by UBI AND higher incomes for people across the board.  

So UNLESS your goal is to keep the incomes of the poor depress by keeping UBI off the table or keeping their wages in the fucking gutter, FOCUSING ON UBI INCREASING RENTS IS A SHIT FRAME !!!!!!!!!!  You focus on why rent and housing is so expensive in the first place, and target that directly, or say, with UBI and higher wages, we need to double and triple our efforts at a local level to to make sure the landlords don't capture the excess.  Better still, we peel back the laws preventing more public housing.  If he said that, I'd have agreed and been on board, but no, he just wanted to take a shot at Yang and UBI in general.

And lastly, nothing about me fits the profile of a NEET, but unlike you, I want those people to be lifted higher off the ground too, along with the homeless and everyone else.  No one deserves to live in abject poverty, and unlike Bernie, I leave off the addendum, IF THEY WORK 40 hours a week.",Labor wages and work conditions.,eywi81r,"probably because minimum wage increases haven't had a noticeable effect on rent.

Some of your concerns about inflation have been addressed though, the main things that will increase are housing, healthcare and education, everything else will stay the same apart from food which may increase slightly. These things can be addressed with policies though. The thing with UBI is that there is a lot of support for it from republican and libertairian voters. Its universally popular, you just have to look at Alaska a deep red state to see how much they like it. What you’re trying to accomplish is not a solution that everyone wants and it will ultimately divide the country even more and nothing will get accomplished.

If they want to do anything outside of living a basic minimum lifestyle, they'll work.

I guarantee you, even if UBI did provide some luxury, most people would still work. If it means the difference between just scraping by and doing better than just scraping by, and saving money or being able to spend it on luxuries, people will work. And there's another side to this coin, too: if UBI is implemented properly, you can get rid of or integrate SNAP, TANF, Medicare, Medicaid, almost any social safety net program you can think of can simply be integrated into UBI because, by definition, there will be no need for those programs any more.

There's another effect people usually don't think of that comes with UBI: the elimination of a minimum wage. It won't be necessary anymore because people will essentially already be provided a minimum wage. It might also elevate wages to a point where most people feel they are adequately compensated for their services. We both know minimum wage today isn't nearly enough to have somebody support themselves, even if they work 40+ hours a week. If UBI were implemented right now, I'm sure some people would walk off the job immediately, but it wouldn't be because they don't need the money anymore, it would be because they wouldn't want to be working in unsafe, unsanitary environments for little pay and no benefits, and employers would quickly restructure their employment structure when an employee's BATNA goes from becoming homeless and hungry to running on a bare minimum budget.

Speaking of employment, I can also imagine that a number of people would walk away to be their own bosses in an entrepreneurial setting, because the risk of failure, again, turns from being homeless and hungry to running on a bare minimum budget. Most of the right claims to be in favor of a free market where any individual can pull themselves up by their bootstraps and make a living through hard work and innovative services or products; nothing would propagate that environment faster than ensuring any individual who had the drive to start their own business selling handcrafted whatever out of their house no longer had to worry about making rent next month.

I'll admit, this is all mostly speculation, based off anecdotal evidence and personal observations, but most of it seems to be backed by what little real-world data exists on giving people something similar to UBI:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_in_Canada

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome

It's worth noting two things about the Mincome experiment:

A. The experiment saw very little rise in the unemployment rates (the highest being 5% for unmarried women, along with 3% for married women and 1% for men overall.) Although it is worth noting that the observation may have been spoiled by the knowledge that the program was only temporary.

B. While only supported by a secondary analysis of a projection of the data, hospital and ER visits dropped by a projected 8.5 percent(!) alongside a reduction in mental health visits.

""But what of the people who will assuredly cheat the system?"" I hear critics ask. Well, what of them now? Certainly there are people who exchange, for example, EBT fraudulently, [but they represent a minuscule part of the system.] (http://time.com/4711668/history-food-stamp-fraud/) It's long been acknowledged that the ""welfare queen"" argument holds little water in the face of the vast majority of people who use and need these programs on a daily basis. 

That said, it still doesn't answer the problems created by that minuscule portion, and certainly some cheaters will continue to exist so long as there is a system to cheat. There's no concrete answer for that, but I've always speculated that if we were able to solve our incarceration problem, there would be a great opportunity to refurbish some prisons into caretaking facilities, ensuring that even those who mismanaged their UBI could still receive that modicum of care and support until they were able to manage it on their own.

The fact is, we are rapidly approaching an age of automation, with self driving cars and trucks, and factories that need little, if any, human intervention. Socially, we are in no position to move into this age, as we already see our most vulnerable citizens as ""Bums, beggars, redneck trailer-trash, drains on the system,"" and so on.

Jubilation.


Adoration.


Spontaneous swearing of everlasting fealty, to be politely turned down, of course.


He hadn't quite expected thrown objects.

""Have they been brainwashed?"" Lady Blackflash asked, wide eyed.


""No"" Mystery murmured, his white eyes glowing faintly. ""Their minds are their own""


""Get out of here!""


""Leave Doctor Tyrant *alone*""


""Never liked your costume!""


Captain Atom shook his head in disbelief ""Are you all insane? Tyrant *conquered the world*. He took it away from you and you are defending him?""


The crow calmed down somewhat. A middle aged man closer to the front answered, arms crossed. ""Yeah right. Do we look like the 1 percent to you?
We never *owned* the world""


""He implemented martial law! A curfew!""


""Where have you been? That was lifted weeks ago!""


The team looked at Techjack who, after a  few moments of concentration nodded hesitantly.


Well, they had been a bit cut off in that pocket dimension, planning their strategy...


Captain Atom gestured around. ""He is controlling your every move! His Tyrantbots are everywhere!""


In fact, multiple of the humanoid, oversized machines were standing at the edges of the plaza right now, watching the proceedings silently. Captain Atom had thought they were biding their time. Now he wasn't so sure.


""Oh yeah, thank God for these. Crime has ever been lower""


""And police brutality!"" a woman chimed in form father back. Agreeing shouts went up


The Captain felt like pulling his hair ""That's because there are *no police officers anymore*""


People shrugged ""So? No one risking their lives, sounds good to me"" More agreeing sounds.


""He made drugs legal to keep you compliant!""


Someone took out his blunt and blew smoke ""That's just, like, your opinion, man""


""He took your jobs!""


""Universal Basic Income"" some shouted while grinning ""It's not much right now, but if his Tyd Talk is correct it will rise steadily in the next years""


""And you *believe* him?!""


More shrugging ""More than our last president"" General shuddering. 


Atom felt like he was loosing control of the situation fast. Because he kinda had to agree there...


""Okay, fine. But that's only possible because his machines do literally all work now. Including that of politicians! You are being ruled by *machines*""


""And they are doing a good job""


""Fastest tax return ever""


""Burgers that actually taste good!""


""It's not like we weren't ruled by smartphones anyway""


""Yeah right? I mean, *my* generation had it under control, but kids these days...""


Captain Atom felt something he hadn't felt in his long career as a superhero. He felt like crying.


No.


No, there had to be a way. An unbeatable argument.


""They are *literally* called Tyrant bots!"" 


The crowd reacted with more shrugging. 


""So? The US nicknamed nuclear ballistic submarines *boomers*. They gave a nickname to horrible weapons of mass destruction. 


The Captain could hear whispering.

^""No ^no ^that ^was ^that ^internet ^thing...4chan, ^I ^think?""


""The T-bots are cool!"" Someone shouted

Abruptly he threw up his arms ""Fine! You know what? Fine. You get your happy little dystopia. But don't come crying to me when it all blows up!""

I’ve speculated this too. Although I have yet to experience any audial or visual hallucinations, I have gone through times of what some might call delusions.

Two years in the house in an isolated area will do that to you. Even today maybe somewhat, I don’t know maybe not.

**You are probably in a mental state where reality and ur imagination are blurred.**

That might just be my “normal”…….

**All the potential problems you’ve listed are inside of your head and have not yet manifested.**

Perhaps, but I have this sensation of my paranoias coming true. It’s hard to say. At least a big part of it may be living with someone who actually takes conspiracy theories seriously. 

**You might be right about some that will happen, but some for sure won’t.**

What about being afraid of ending up a 30-40+ year old virgin who still hasn’t even had a girlfriend or kissed? My fear of this is based off the fact that so many girls have told me how (explicitly) ugly I am, and the fact that genuine 30-40+ year old virgin men exist, and they (at least they claim) to even do well financially and “asked out so many women”.

My thinking is, if nothing ever happened to me by 25 and I’ve already gotten so many “you’re so fucking ugly” and/or other insults (because lying that she has a boyfriend or politely declining isn’t enough, gotta add insult to injury) and other guys much older than me are still in my position.

The movie “The 40 Year Old Virgin” is less funny when you realize it’s a real life problem, even worse is the existence of “incels”, “MGTOW”, the culture/movement of women accusing men of false rape, etc…..

To make it worse and even less likely to change in the near future, I have all these other issues. Struggle getting and maintaining DECENT employment (2 years doing super unskilled labor for less than $11 an hour won’t pay rent ANYWHERE, and the job itself is so stigmatized as well) and now all this trauma and the level of deepness I think and over analyze things probably makes any kind of genuine connection even harder.

**This happens to people who been shut out of society and social settings for too long.**

This definitely applies to me. My right-wing conspiracy paranoid step father literally keeps talking about planning to go “off-grid” when the “New World Order” officially starts, because “socialism” will take over and is “already in effect”. 

I think I’d rather just stay and be tracked and monitored by the government, fuck going “off-grid”. (Rural living or “out in the country”, isn’t even “off grid”, it’s legitimately so far out it’s unclaimed land without any kind of modern living infrastructure (electricity or plumbing).

And of course, no doctors or pharmacies, I’m too dependent on modern medicine, and I’d just rather live in a “government controlled” society.

Honestly, I don’t know what this “socialist/government takeover” would really consist of, I’m doubtful of it even happening. But I surely can’t go “off-grid”, especially with someone like him.

I never got to enjoy my fucking life, and I’m not about to let some “government takeover” SEAL MY FATE.

Seriously, it’s the CORPORATIONS who rule and run America, not the GOVERNMENT.

Step dad quotes “The Bible” as his proof. I feel “The Bible”, being such an ancient book, could easily have been altered, whether intentionally or unintentionally.

My biggest theory on why he has anger issues and this paranoia about “the government coming to take our guns and force us to take the vaccine” is that he suffered brain damage from past drug abuse.

Sure, he may have got clean, but people suffer permanent damage from drugs, supposedly even prescription ones like I take……

I’m not about to let this SUPPOSED “socialist” takeover PERMANENTLY ruin the rest of my life by going to hide and die OFF GRID.

It was BAD ENOUGH being stuck in the house in a rural area for years, I’M NOT GOING OFF GRID!!!!!!

Conspiracies like these have been predicted OVER AND OVER YEAR AFTER YEAR, so I’m really not worried about this “doomsday” scenario actually happened.

I may be wrong, but imagine a “socialist” shift that may cause my step dad to run off the grid ACTUALLY being something helpful to millions of people, like Universal Health Care or Universal Basic Income. But he claims that those things aren’t even the “true dangers”.

Basically, he’s taking politics and religion too seriously, and he already seems mentally unstable.

&gt; As third world countries become more prosperous their birth rates drop, eventually below replacement levels.

Youre turning the causality upside down. It's dropping birth rates that cause more individual prosperity. However this doesnt affect the global growth rate. There will always be populations who breed to the limit of starvation. It's simple math: those who breed will dominate the future while those with dropping birth rates will wane. Iran is a good example. The rural populations have high birth rates, their excess offspring goes to the growing cities, get education, job, fewer kids, becomes prosperous. The cities grow but only due to the constant influx from the rural population. Same with Europe as a whole, only that the influx comes from third world low-IQ-high-birthrate countries. 

The greatest power of life lies in the urge to breed exponentially. Nothing can beat that. Nothing can beat mathematics.

**""republikkkans hate poor people and liberals just want to help empower everyone!!11""**


","Economic systems, Money and inflation.",cn5t8bw,"There are two basic areas of impact. 

One is labor market participation, the other is the price of labor. 

On the first point, you get an optimistic and a pessimistic projection. The pessimistic projection is that people drop out of the labor market like flies and productivity plummets and we see a new underclass that sits back, receives their UBI, and spends it. In this scenario, you would see some economic gain in the increased consumption (it's a very broad Keynesian move to just dump money into the hands of people who are certain to spend it) but the decline in productivity would hurt businesses, drive up costs of goods, and probably negate the benefit. Whatever the UBI would be would quickly become not enough to get by, inflation would rise, and any gains would be temporary. 

The optimistic projection is that people act like people and want more than what they get. They take their UBI and try to grow it. That means investment, people working jobs they *want* to work or even start new businesses, and lots of economic growth. Inflation is probably going to be a problem with any UBI, but if productivity keeps up and the whole thing plays out less like crisis-based Keynesianism but more like modest redistribution, it could level the economic playing field and recreate some of the pathways to economic mobility that have been disappearing since the 1970's. 

On the second point (labor price) there are also optimistic and pessimistic projections. The pessimistic one is that it forces the cost of labor through the roof and the resulting inflation again destroys any gains you'd hope for. In this scenario, no one wants to work and so they refuse and employers have to offer obscene compensation to lure people to work. The other alternative is that you see a massive upswing in automation and outsourcing and the labor market becomes even less fruitful for average workers. 

The optimistic projection is that the labor market actually starts to function again. Right now, the option to refuse a job offer is a wildly unrealistic one for most families. You don't have a job and someone offers one, you take it. Period. If there was a UBI, employers offering shitty positions would actually have to make them more attractive somehow (which is how it's supposed to work anyway). Basically, the bargaining power of the two sides would come closer to equilibrium. 

Bottom line is that our labor market is overcrowded as it is. We could use some innovation and some economic freedom because I'd be willing to bet that if Steve Jobs was born today, he wouldn't have the time to start Apple in his garage. In that sense, it'd be good to have some less ambitious people drop safely out of the labor market, give workers a bit more leverage, and open the door to innovative minds to experiment without the crushing financial pressure forcing them into giving away their free time and mental energy for a pittance. 

It really comes down to a question of whether you see Americans as inherently lazy, unambitious, slovenly wretches or if you think people want more from life than leisure. But that's the divide between liberals and conservatives on all social welfare issues. Conservatives think the underclass is a gaggle of mooches. Liberals think people just need a little help and deserve it and will surprise you if you let them.

You see, prices and the value if currency are determined by supply and demand (in the long run).

So, if everyone gets a 1000 dollars, then everyone gets a 1000 dollars. 

The issue you pointed out is nonetheless valid. Some landlords might raise the rent. But why would that happen? 
--&gt; simply because UBI raised the Demand in that particular market. More people have access to a roof thanks to that 1000$, so prices increase. 

But in the long run, the increase in prices make this particular market more trendy, and as the price goes up, the supply goes up too. New buildings are created to accommodate to the demand. That and competition tends to reduce the price.

By empowering people to run for office and actually win. By empowering the poor to no longer be poor - to have the financial stability that allows more political activism &amp; engagement.

As UBI enables individuals, families, and communities to grow their wealth, those people will demand better representation or run &amp; provide it themselves. Flint's residents will fix their own water supply without having to rely on the Federal government. 

It's all about growth. 

&gt; There are still corporations sitting on trillions of dollars and near infinite resources at their disposal.

The problem isn't wealth. The problem is poverty. 

&gt; What do you think giving Americans 2k a month will do about that?

It would address the immediate concern of poverty on the ground, and ultimately give all recipients the political power that comes with increased stability &amp; wealth.

And obviously when people like you and me and others who want corporations to pay their fair share are no longer stuck in wage slavery, or even worse conditions - we'll be able to do something about it. I'd love to run for office but I can't afford it. I work 6 days a week just to keep a roof over my head &amp; food on the table.

&gt; And they will kill even more of them when they try to fix it.

That's kind of ludicrous. Who are 'they?' How will 'they' kill us? We're dying already from poverty and this pandemic. That collapse will come for them, too, if a UBI isn't implemented in the next term.

&gt; If you think 2k a month is worth dying for, I guess that's your call.

It would eradicate poverty. That's unprecedented.

&gt; We are still facing collapse with UBI.

How so?

&gt; If anything, consumption increases with a UBI, and the companies still have no incentive to implement sustainable or ethical practices

No? How?

&gt;The only way to avert total collapse is UBI, and the passage of that will erode the duopoly, oligarchy, and everything else that's worked against the interests of the people.

How will a UBI do that? There are still corporations sitting on trillions of dollars and near infinite resources at their disposal. What do you think giving Americans 2k a month will do about that?

&gt;And working people are dying by the hundreds - thousands - and will be doing even more dying as poverty continues to worsen.

'Better' jobs are those that employ people full-time and pay a wage you can live on. What we have now, especially in retail, is a circus of part-time, irregularly scheduled jobs that require workers to juggle the rest of their lives around work designed to keep them below thresholds for benefits and overtime.  Part of what drives that circus is minimum wage.  

'Better' jobs, to me, could include manufacturing jobs. No, I'm not some nostalgic looking back to the (exceptional) days of the 50's and 60's and wishing we could go back to when 'America was great!' or some nonsense like that. Quite the opposite, I see a future not too far off where the cheap fossil fuels that have driven offshoring  become expensive. And when that happens, tons of manufactured items will need to be made in America.  

Automation will compete with workers in the factory, already does in fact. So I don't hold up manufacturing as some kind of solution that will provide full employment for everyone, not by a long shot. But there will be plenty of opportunities for jobs that pay above (current day) minimum and yet aren't worth automating. At least for awhile.   

That's one example of a path to 'better' jobs.    

I'll tell you now, I think all jobs are temporary and the entire labor market is on its last few decades. Automation of everything is well under way (cars, trucks, buses, cashiers, surgeons, etc) and the number of humans involved in economically productive activities is just going to decrease every year.    

I work with a piece of software that has automated the process of engineering new products, I personally eliminated 2 full-time engineers in 2016 via a small automation project. Small in the grand scheme of things, it was a big deal to me. Regardless, I dropped 2 more guys into the unemployed bucket in Georgia last year. So far as I can tell, in the last 6 years, I have never worked on a project that led to more humans being employed. It's always a reduction in people, or the same people carrying more productivity.

Why do you assume that if you end up on a basic income you will suddenly become irrelevant? There is absolutely nothing stopping you from engaging in activities that enrich your own life or the lives of others.

yes, you did: the welfare cliff.  under current assistance programs, people tend to earn less overall money if they accept a raise, work more hours, or get a job in the first place.

This allows a less painful way out of poverty while the current assistance programs tend to perpetuate the cycle of poverty, even though they do make poverty suck less.

If you did just give money to people, poverty would no longer have many causes.  It would no longer have any causes.  It would be abolished.

Consider the analogous situation in ancient Athens.  They had slavery, and unlike racist USA slavery, anyone could be a slave.  Slavery had many causes; people could be captured in war; they could sell themselves into slavery to pay off debt (which itself could happen for many causes); they could be made slaves as punishment for a crime.

And yet abolishing slavery eliminates all of the causes of slavery, because although the causes still exist as phenomena, they no longer cause slavery.

The same thing is true about a basic income guarantee.  All of the things that cause poverty *today* would no longer cause poverty, because poverty would be abolished.

&gt; It would be nice if giving money broke the cycle of poverty, but unless people are educated and know how to handle money, just giving it to them isn't going to solve anything.

Anyone putting 60 hours a week into their work is hurting themselves and the work. You simply aren't as productive as you would be if you let your body regenerate properly. The reduced work time is a feature, not a bug.

&gt; Then there are many others who will simply make do and be on UBI alone.

And if they really are only taking the minimum, then they won't be a drag either. And what you're describing isn't a steady state. Nearly all people start doing something productive after a long enough time of non-productivity. Previous UBI studies mentioned elsewhere in this thread have shown no negative effect on work ethic.

And for the tiny percentage remaining who really just don't want to contribute... do you really want that kind of person clogging up a productive workplace and bringing everyone else down with them? Better to let the most productive people do the work. This is another great feature of UBI - the people remaining in the workforce are the intrinsically motivated people (as opposed to 'just being in it for the money'), so the quality of the workforce goes up greatly.

That said if you're worried about tax incentives (which is separate from the basic income's incentive to work btw), instead of using a simple escalating tax brackets system, you could do an income tax function that uses the same [sinusoidal-ish curve that video games use for difficulty](http://blog.rpgmakerweb.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/wave.png) in their progression systems.

220,"I think one thing you are forgetting within your analysis is forgetting one thing about Ultra Millionaires and Billionaires when it comes to the incentives.  Money = power in our society so intrinsically the more money you have the more political power you have.  Until such a time that we can decouple money and power, we need a way to prevent any individual from accumulating so much wealth that they get more power than they should.  This is why I have an ""us vs them"" mentality.  It isn't because they are bad people necessarily but the incentive structure of politics and our economy inherently drives them to make decisions that are worse for everyone if it even benefits them a little bit.  This isn't some conspiracy this is just incentives working against the general populace.  The problem is they have the power to manifest their own personal desires in our political system with their vast sums of wealth.  Until the global economy transitions away from a capitalist system (not happening any time soon) the only way to limit the power of the wealthy is to limit the amount of wealth they can accumulate because if they can accumulate that much wealth they will use the power that comes along with it to make society worse, again it isn't because they are evil it is because the incentive structure of capitalism forces them to make those decisions.   


I advocate for all the policy positions that theoretically would help mitigate those problems like you mentioned, reforming taxation, increasing social benefits via UBI, Single-Payer Healthcare, and other Robust Social Safety net measures, Campaign finance reform, and lobbying reform.  However, we had many of these regulations in place after the new deal and the rich slowly undid them through the capture of the mechanisms of power like the courts and congress.  Capitalism just incentivizes them to make those types of decisions and history has shown they will undermine systems with their wealth to push their own agendas. This is an inherent problem with capitalism and you can't really remove this problem from the system because capitalism places financial resources (I.e capital) as the way to gain power under capitalism.  This is one of capitalism's greatest flaws.  If you want to keep capitalism you need to limit wealth accumulation.  


There is a way to mitigate this problem by encouraging worker co-ops and strong unions through workplace democracy.  Workplace democracy spreads the wealth of a firm among the workers and encourages them to make decisions that are better for average people.  Granted there are still problems with systems like this for example a fossil fuel union would be against climate action just like fossil fuel companies but I do think a system of that nature would be more egalitarian because at the very least it is easier to bargain with workers trying to ensure financial security rather than trying to reason with a billionaire oligarch intent on keeping their political power.",Economic systems.,hfgxunt,"Thanks for the insightful comment.

I think this excerpt sums up your argument. On a whole they’re just doing what’s most rational. But even if you regulated wealth, this behavior doesn’t go away. People will always try to make rational decisions (hopefully). Instead of regulating wealth wouldn’t it be far more beneficial to reform taxation, social benefits,  campaign financing and lobbying policy?

The core concept is that due to the advances in computer processing power technology and cost reduction- it's becoming more and more practical to automate more than just predictable physical labor.


The [impact automation will have on inequality](http://overbreakeven.com/2017/02/25/will-robots-take-our-jobs-automation-and-the-universal-basic-income/), capitalism and structural unemployment will be massive. One of the responses to this is to implement a Universal Basic Income. Think a base level of income for every human on the planet to recognize the fact that there simply wont be enough jobs to go around. The future of capitalism hinges on this too-  If we aren't getting paid, who is there to buy what the robots are making? 


Obviously one of the biggest problems with the UBI is who pays for it. Bill Gates spoke out recently about the concept of introducing a machine tax which is an interesting concept. If we tax human labor on its produce, why not tax machines in the same way?


Millennials have been the first generation to see massive increases in the cost of education that doesn't have the same return on investment that it used to. The dream of a standard of living close to their parents is slipping away. They've got enough to deal with. I would love to see millennials be the first generation to actually benefit from advances in automation.

Yeah, that isn't a fun thought.

260,"Gotta read that series sometime, but from you description it sounds like a take on Basic Income /Socialism from the perspective of someone living in mid 1900s and using Soviet Union as their primary example.

&gt;Proper advanced education is only accessible for those who spend years in volunteer work to prove they have the intelligence (self study) and work ethic (volunteer work) to be worth the investment of education.

with the exception of relatively few fields where expensive lab lessons are a necessity, providing 'advanced' education is no more of an expensive investment that proving internet and a basic computer. Once you account for today's computer simulation and modeling, the number of such fields goes to zero fast. With the technology we have today, there would be zero valid reasons to restrict education like that, once proprietary licensing is out of the picture.

&gt;cueing up for food... and other living necessities 

is a very clear dig at Soviet Union which was famous for needing to stand in line for everything

However those lines weren't a symptom of socialism/basic income - it was a result of extremely badly managed planned economy, awfully designed distribution systems and very low level of technological development of the country. (people looking at SU frequently don't take into account that the country basically started with 2 decades of killing almost everyone with any education or knowledge of how to do anything more than manual work, than spent the next 50 years trying to recover from that brain trauma and were constantly hampered by a conflicting ideology that prioritized manual labor over actual results)

Tl,DR - Just based on your description, that would be the most plausible result of basic income if we removed the last 20 years of our technological development. Modern technology though would make half the things you describe be counter productive to even try to implement that badly.
",Taxonomy: Economic systems.,d2qzmcw,"The expanse scifi novels paint a picture of basic income that is entirely too believable.

Essentially humanity is born into basic which means that food and housing is assigned. Assigned meaning that changes in relationship and familial status like deaths and separations warrant immediate relocation to optimise living space distribution. Education exists in the form of online courses for people to teach themselves and their children. Proper advanced education is only accessible for those who spend years in volunteer work to prove they have the intelligence (self study) and work ethic (volunteer work) to be worth the investment of education.

Things like medical help are available but so strained that being on basic basically means your full time job is cueing up for food, medicine and everything else you need to live. There’s also a maximum investment per life before the decision is made to switch to hospice care to let an individual die. Better medical care is available for those who contribute to society instead of leeching basic.

Essentially it turned earth into a global slum where billions willingly languish in basic without the will to turn themselves into self sufficient citizens.

Frankly I find this to be the most likely outcome of basic income by far. Human overpopulation is going to create millions if not billions of unneeded, unwanted people and short of extermination the only solution is to provide them with minimal basic care while focussing resources on the minority that actively enrich the human race with progress. It’ll turn into a self perpetuating problem where people on basic produce more people unlikely to ever rise beyond basic.

It’s really not that different from the current situation where many unemployed and low educated people stand a higher than average chance of producing offspring who’ll never rise beyond the accomplishments of their parents. Just extrapolated to the expected overpopulation and lack of employment opportunity of the future.

&gt;And no, ""just go find a new job"" is a bullshit cop-out of an answer ignoring all reality and nuance of our society and economy. Hell, this very subreddit is built around the idea of a UBI *because* of the fact that people are wage-slaves in an economy that, should they lose their job, they can basically just go die in a gutter due to the lack of safety nets there to help them survive until they find new employment.

He called him something like, ""one of the most unfairly maligned people of my lifetime,"" or something.

Eventually Ezra Klein agreed and Sam looked like a complete fucking fool. He said that the Vox article accused him of racism. (It didn't, though, at this point, it's pretty clear that Sam is actually a racist)

Sam kept saying that the history of academic racism didn't matter to the discussion at hand, which was absurd.

Sam responded by saying that Charles Murray supported Universal Basic Income. Klein pointed out that Murray's UBI proposal basically slashed the money spent on social welfare in the country in half and distributed it universally, which would have left poor families in the US nearly completely destitute.

We do not want anyone to confuse you for a Democrat-lite or a fringe candidate either.  Too many candidates are only focused on one issue, and while UBI would be one of the greatest accomplishments of an American Presidency, being prepared for whatever is thrown at you is incredibly important.  I like seeing your viewpoints on all of your goals and viewpoints.  And, in many cases, there are ways to alienate yourself.  The abortion debate, regardless of your side, is very contentious, and you should have a response that does not lock you into one side or the other of the debate.  I am, like many Americans, neither pro-life or pro-choice.  We do not want to see it eliminated, and we do not want to see it as a way to shirk responsibility.  It is an important medical tool and should be used as such.  This is just an example.  Do not let them try to trap you into a soundbite.  We saw this with Gary Johnson.  No news organization was mentioning him at all.  They started throwing out questions with various acronyms, and he hears ""What about Alepo?"" and thinks it is some acronym like the others, and boom, you have the news attacking him constantly.  They were simply waiting for their chance to strike.  His message?  Irrelevant.  They only wanted to talk about him when it was negative.

Also, as silly as it sounds, I think memes are powerful.  Like, silly picture memes.  Just as ideas grow and spread, the Internet is full of attention grabbing points of interest that have nothing to do with policy.  Yang riding a horse with his shirt off kind of memes.  If originating from your campaign itself it could seem contrived or lack seriousness or pandering, but originating from the Internet itself, this can make people more aware of you.  While I hate seeing subreddits bogged down by this, we can use something that is actually funny for promotion purposes.  ""Who is this guy in all of these pictures?""  So, while it is important to stay serious (from your perspective), make sure you never try to crack down on those that are willing to spread your message in strange ways.

Even bad publicity is often better than none.  We have seen many candidates never even mentioned on broadcasts even if they had high polling rates compared to others.  Yourself, Bernie Sanders, Gary Johnson, Ron Paul are all examples, and while their messages and focus may be completely different than yours, it is important to stand out ahead of the crowd.  I want to see either you or Bernie Sanders as the Democratic candidate, but neither of you are part of the 'establishment' which I believe will make your fight incredibly hard.

If you want to do that you need to supply those studies. Our users, myself included, are not obligated to supply those studies for your argument. If anything that’s you being lazy and wanting us to do *your* homework. You don’t want to cite your sources? Then don’t bring them up.

So you’re citing me an article, not a study. That’s not a good start, and in that article it links to a trial by “Jesse Cunha of the Naval Postgraduate School... of cash versus in-kind transfers in rural Mexico.” Well. Surely that’s an analogue for the entirety of the United States. Not to mention that the entire contention of my argument was not that people shouldn’t be given the same value in cash that they can spend as they see fit, but that less value in cash isn’t a substitute, but let’s see what this study shows.

Oh...well that’s odd. There’s nothing here. That link goes absolutely nowhere. Let’s use our google powers. We’re on the internet after all, let me do your homework for you! 

Well I managed to find it, but I have to say this isn’t the comprehensive open and shut slam dunk you promised me. See, this doesn’t cover the broad range of healthcare and housing solutions people need, and it takes place in a very different environment than something you could abstract and generalize to the whole country.

The second study they link to in order to bolster their argument only argues that vouchers are more effective than direct food assistance. Sure. It also recognizes the benefits of “near-cash” transfers like food stamps from previous studies (Blackorby and Donaldson, 1988, Curie and Gahvari, 2008, Dreze, 1990) which “are advantageous because only those truly in need will take-up these in-kind benefits, and consequently, in-kind transfers may be less distortionary than cash transfers...in-kind transfers are more efficient than cash transfers even under conditions of perfect information.”

The most important line comes later “To our knowledge, this is the first study that directly compares three different types of food assistance side by side, and thus contributes to the existing literature.” Doesn’t sound to me like the sources abound here.

This study essentially concluded that near-cash transfers, not cash transfers are the most efficient. That goes against your point, not for it. And even this study had to reference the (Cuhna, 2012) study from the first link to gain a foothold on the premise.

All you have here is a single small time study in rural Mexico. I’m sorry, that’s just not convincing enough.

What you’re doing, by the way is called a motte and bailey. See, you began this by telling me that it was preferable to have citizens choose the lesser valued UBI because that will give them a greater overall benefit than the more valuable food and healthcare benefits because (unlike me - nice potshot by the way) they mostly know how to better spend that money. That’s a really hard thing to defend. This is the motte. You moved past this quickly because you didn’t intend to defend this directly.

Especially because inherent to that argument is the consequence that if they don’t do a better job of stretching that 1000 dollars to cover all of their food and healthcare shortages, they’re just fucked and it’s guaranteed that many people would necessarily fall into that category. I don’t give three shits that it’s paternalistic, I care that the results are positive for the maximum amount of people.

The Bailey is where you retreat to argue an easier position instead while pretending it’s the same argument. Now you’re arguing that studies show cash is better than direct transfers of goods. This of course leaves out key components like the government being able to leverage a massive amount of negotiating power if we consolidated the entire nation’s healthcare but let’s set that aside. Now you’re only arguing in principle that cash might be more effective in some cases.

And all you gave me was a cash transfer program in rural Mexico that was a slight improvement on a program that is in no way comparable to what we’re talking about right now.

It has value due to taxes and/or consent to take it for wares and services. It's customer spending, it is not only a reflection of work that went into producing things (but also of rental claims and political arrangements). Spending money is a signal to produce more things, sometimes even on the fly as the payment takes place. Also nobody suggests to print an infinite amount of money so consequently there is scarcity of money. Ask em to specify what they assume a UBI would look like.

&gt; This would make so much debt for the US government and make us end up like Venezuela or worse.

This claim makes zero sense. How do we start arguing against unrelated topics? Not sure. Maybe ask em (whoever makes these arguments) how this connects to UBI in any way shape or form and work with what you get. Like you can tax fund a UBI and reserve money issuing to functionally managing the private banking sector via modern debt jubilees.

&gt; If you base this on economics, statistics, and how it leads to laziness.

&gt; Finland tried this and failed.

Ask em how Finland tried this and how it failed. In reality Finland neither tried it nor did what they try fail.

&gt; Unemployment is already extremely low right now if that is your argument.

I would not make this my argument because we can use spoons instead of shovels and everyone has a job. Are people taking home a living wage from 35 hours of work a week for a family of 4? The tendency is no and increasingly no for many people.

&gt; Right now we are at about the simple AI level, they are not to such a degree where they can do everything. There is no need for an alternative.

I wouldn't approach UBI from this perspective in the first place, though preparing society isn't half bad either.

UBI is a means to produce a more free market and empower people to act responsibility when choosing one's work. It allows people to act much more nimble where legislators fail to price externalities into products, where work environments are unsafe and so on. It allows people to fill roles less based on the wealth they inherit and more based on merit. It also allows people to do more valuable work that is communal, political or entrepreneurial. As opposed to focusing on serving a rentier's bottom line [at a declining rate of return](http://www.scottsantens.com/everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-history-and-future-of-jobs-is-likely-wrong)

&gt; It is shown it is bad for productivity, it does not work.

Move away from GDP and it becomes clear that it's good for productivity. Even within the confines of GDP it is extremely functional.

&gt; Universal basic income will not work unless there is no need for human labor, then the laziness attributes ute wont negatively affect the economy that people depend on as the backbone of society.

UBI makes people less lazy. A pathway to self respect through work and reciprocity while maintaining a sense of self-determination is leaps and bounds better than what the current labor market affords many.

&gt; find a few different way to derive value

I'm a big fan of a land value tax, sovereign wealth funds and novel ways to sap money from the economy where money changes hands (or accumulates) due to economies of scale, network effects, idea rights and so on. Like mandatory contributions to a sovereign wealth fund if you want brand name/idea rights/etc protected in this country. Also regulate and facilitate banking better, also via modern debt jubilees so you don't produce a situation where bank money printing leads to [consolidation of stuff in the hands of a few](https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/the-ten-graphs-which-show-how-britain-became-a-wholly-owned-subsiduary-of-the-city-of-london-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/).

It’d be an absolute disaster and I don’t think you’d be hard pressed to find many that would disagree. We have massive inequity in today’s society that will be 100x harder to resolve when the majority of people have nothing. Imagine if we decided to do a UBI then.

UK housing, particularly London property is seen as a AAA investment the world over. The building I used to work at was owned by Gadafi.

Demand wants to buy more than Supply wants to sell.

So it's constant upward pressure which in turn attracts investors, classic bubble.

It is even worse than that. I live in a mixed income building. Half the apartments require free market rent prices. The other half a hugely subsidized by the state and city for low or no income renters.

UBI is NOT a Bernie policy so why did you bring him up and act like it was his policy to begin with? And if you can't get basic facts like that right, you really don't have credibility to continue this debate. Your claims about UBI aren't even based on ANY FACTS OR DATA, you're literally just repeating something I've heard Joe Rogan say verbatim, proving that he spreads misinformation that his followers hear and repeat it, like its a fact.

There are places that have actually tested UBI and collected data on the outcomes. I suggest consulting the DATA produced by those studies IF you want to pretend like you care about having an honest debate on the effects of UBI.. 

Alaska for instance has had UBI for decades and..

""Economists investigated whether the payment was leading people to work less and found that “the dividend had no effect on employment” overall""

And looking at EVERYWHERE that is currently or planning to experiment with UBI..

And I find it funny that you think the cause of global inflation was the money given to citizens in the pandemic unemployment program which wasn't even a trillion (794 billion) dollars here, but don't even mention the MULTIPLE trillions that went DIRECTLY into the stock market to prop it up.. Ya know, all the bonds, securities, and stocks the fed purchased and spent more than 4 TRILLION DOLLARS in new printed money to do so? You don't seem to be aware of this reality despite it being the vast majority of money that was printed. the money printed in the USA.

If you're going to blame the US government for global or local inflation, let's at least be honest about what money was printed and WHERE IT WAS GIVEN OUT!  .

Every recession, corporations and banks considered  ""too big to fail"" are bailed out as a reward for their greed, and taxpayers are left with the bill meaning essentially that WE bailed them out. This time, taxpayers actually got some of THEIR OWN MONEY back with the pandemic assistance, it was a TINY FRACTION of the total money printed!

It's classic CORPORATE BRAINWASH to blame ANY citizen's assistance program for inflation! Its NOTHING compared to what the government spent on the stock market just to keep corporations and CEOs afloat!

I'm guessing you don't understand how to generally calculate the real cost of government assistance programs either, based on the generalizations you made in these comments. Just like any other business investment in the real world, you MUST look at your ROI. ROI= Return on Investment, you never just look at the INITIAL COST.

Pandemic assistance (to the middle class) had two separate returns on investment, it kept a lot of people from losing their homes and allowed them to survive by spending that money on critical goods and services that kept them off the streets, kept their healthcare, etc.. Once families and individuals end up on the streets, they cost taxpayers MUCH more money through city resources- police, prisons, ambulances, food and shelter programs, foster care problems etc etc. Rarely do people include these savings when talking about the COST of any assistance. The secondary return on this investment is that it also saves the small businesses AND large corporations that the middle class is spending their assistance money to support.. Meaning those employees, owners and CEOs still get to live as well, and turn a profit, that if saved and re-invested properly, means they continue to exist beyond the assistance money coming in. The trillions spent on securities, and bonds/stocks, just allowed for stock buy backs and was just so the CEOs and major corporations could avoid having any real risk at all, and this money just pads the CEOs it doesn't get spent back into the economy through goods and services- THIS IS THE TYPE OF MONEY THAT CAUSES INFLATION.

Money that sits offshore or sits in the stock market or sits in bonds and securities, is NOT money that circulates in the economy by being spent on goods and services!

By its very nature, this ""stagnant"" money just sits there and causes inflation because it requires more money to be printed into circulation, so that the middle class can get more money through wages or assistance, which in turn allows more spending on goods and services

I prefer universal healthcare and universal education, along with a universal jobs guarantee over UBI, but I have demonstrated extensively here that pandemic assistance to the middle class wasn't the main factor behind inflation, and in fact prevented us from going into a much LARGER PROBLEM WITH MILLIONS LOSING THEIR HOMES...

Again, don't take this personal, I'm writing all of this because so many people don't understand economics and just repeat what they hear from the media or their favorite pod cast.

I'm hoping more people besides just you read it and get something out of it. Feel free to ask questions or debate further, but I suggest doing actual research and using actual data before responding.....","Money and inflation, Data analysis and research.",iede535,"You're arguing with a strawman.

Maybe in Venezuela, his policies might be ""centrist"" or in the failing economies of Spain, France and Italy they might be only ""centre-left"". The better an economy gets, the more 'left wing"" his policies become, I'm sure you might have observed this. **Policies should never be made in favor of renters, but home owners**, which is what the US prides itself on. **US has 73.5% white home ownership rate, and a 67% overall home ownership rate, higher than any Western European country and most American homes are actual houses, not apartments; most countries in the EU have a sub 5% home ownership rate if you only count detached housing and non leaseholds. Almost all apartments are leaseholds and have a 100-year lifespan before they get knocked down. Moreover,** the US should seek to increase that to over 80-90%. Home ownership builds wealth and prevents state dependency while ensuring economic productivity. Even Biden's ""housing policy"" is in realizing how retarded rent control is. It is an abjectly selfish policy to push for rent control and it goes against the common good of the middle class and upper class. Rent control ONLY assists the least productive members of society and harms everyone else. Rent control, in a hilarious enough way, is seen as one of the worst forms of economic rent seeking. **Most economists agree on this, it's a consensus issue:** [**rent control is retarded**](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/09/19/rent-control-will-make-housing-shortages-worse)**.** 
2. Depends what you consider ""acceptable living"". [**Most Poor Americans actually live lives identical to middle class Europeans**](https://fee.org/articles/the-poorest-20-of-americans-are-richer-than-most-nations-of-europe/)**;** **living in a project with medicaid in an ""inner city"" is exactly how Europeans live.** The INEQUALITY and effort put into said life is more in the US, maybe. But the lifestyle exactly is identical. Its just that America is more inequal, and people are naturally envious. **Poor Americans are JEALOUS, to put it simply, because the rich in America own houses and Teslas and the super rich own private jets and yachts.** In Europe, the poor European will get to live in a rent controlled apartment in the city center of Berlin with the same rent, forever, will be materially actually slightly poorer than the equal American, but the rich European will be regulated and taxed into being forced to live in an apartment as well, just to pay rents and live only marginally better in a similar location. Meanwhile the poor American will live in an irrelevant city making slightly more money and paying much less rent, while the rich American can afford to own an apartment in Manhattan.
3. Since you're here in Munich too, why don't you stop lying to everyone here and explain the fact it takes 1 hour to get from a place like Mittersendling to Olympiazentrum, minimum. Especially given the walking time to U-Bahn stations, and the switch ups necessary to go from U-6 to U-3 and so on? Or the fact that people here who can afford to, still buy a BMW so they dont waste 1 hour taking third world tier transport to go 10-15km? Also you're wrong, the US has comprehensive bus public transit by law covering nearly every 1 square mile of space in urban areas. I lived there, I know. Its just that literally ZERO Americans would tolerate taking 1 hour to go 10km. While people here happily do. The reason you'd make barely anything is German costs of living and car costs, in the US car costs are extremely low. Blame the ""green new deal"" for this. I worked as a software engineer in the US, I was making $100k net. Here I work as a SWE, I make $52k gross, roughly. Im making $33k net. And post rent I save $200 a month. In the US I was saving about $5500 a month. Let that sink in. Isarcard here is $60 for within the M-Zone, but I live outside the M-Zone and it costs $150 a month. $1800 a month on a fucking train that takes forever. In the US I was spending roughly $250 a month including gas and insurance. So I was spending $100 more monthly for a car I actually owned and convenience I had 100x more and I could go ANYWHERE with no limits. 
4. **Germany has UBI it is Hartz IV ALG II, anyone can be a NEET and live at home and shop for for for 200 euro a week**, have rent covered for a studio apartment and play video games all day and get paid for it by the German government because **you get statutory 432 + rent + heating** without preconditions. If you strategize with a girlfriend and get a union it doubles the sum. This is the problem, these shitty programs take up so much money that is the reason our tax system is so high. Pensions are already high due to the retiring boomers and they add in these dumb welfare programs. **It's not a BIT LESS for middle class, stop lying, look at the graph its THIRTY PERCENT**, that is the amount spent on housing. **THIRTY PERCENT IS HUGE. That is the difference between Italy and Poland in avg incomes**.  "" you are right people in higher income stratas in europe will probably pay more in taxes than in the states "" [In the US THIRTY PERCENT of the households earns more than $100k a year](https://www.census.gov/content/census/en/library/publications/2018/demo/p60-263.html), in Germany its THREE PERCENT.  Literally 80-90% of society is worse off here and I find it extremely irritating that Germans here are blind to how worse off they are. **You think renting an apartment, paying your landlord, and never being able to own anything is ""good"" lifestyle?** **It's the lifestyle of a slave**, except you are enslaved here to both the unproductive rent seeking poor and the unproductive government socialists.  "" give up on owning the newest porsche for last years model "" **Again stop fucking lying, jesus. Why do people here always do this? Its not a porsche, most people here cant even own their own fucking house or a 100m2 apartment, let alone a car. Most Germans have no savings, and you are fine with this so ""NEETs"" can do nothing and play video games all day? I am not, I am going to leave to Switzerland in 3 months, have fun as this shitty system collapses. Alteast Switzerland forces unproductive people to pay back welfare and has stringent welfare limits. Already have a job offer with TC 130k CHF, 110k CHF post tax, 4 times my net salary here.**","- Living costs

- None of the above",fsjnao2,"1. The US does have less overall housing regulation, which can lead to more competition and lower prices. But, it also has serious downsides, ie in several states there is no cap on how much your rent can increase year to year. In several areas near where I grew up this was as much as 40-60% from one year to the next. Rent control laws dont only have downsides. So on that last comment the policies that ""leftists push for in CA or NY are often center positions in europe. Even Bernies policies are not comparable to many truely left policies in eueope.

2. Here id point out that if you use median to compare two groups you also have to recognize that the US has more truely poor people than most european countries. So the median american may have a higher income, but the entire botom 20% of the US is worse off. Compare minimum incomes, in the US its a little over $7. In germany, Luxemburg, the netherlands its over $10. With the social net in europe, people can more easily afford an acceptable living even if they work in fastfood or in warehouses. 
This money has to come from somewheres and as a society people have agreed to pay higher taxes so that people working these jobs can live dignified lives. 

3. Ive taken public transit in munich for several years now and its been able to get me anywhere I need to go relativly cheaply. In the states with my parents I am fortunate to be able to drive my parents car, without paying for gas. The cost just to put me on the insurence plan for 3 months, is more than my semester ticket costs for half a year. 
You are right most people who can drive a car do. The difference is that in europe many accept it as a luxury and are willing to pay for it. If people want to spend their money on a new german car, go for it. In the US its a requirement. In my town theres only 2 buses and they only go to school. If I were to work downtown I would have to walk at least an hour both ways (in a small town). In germany my work is across town, a 1 1/2 hour transit every day. If I had to buy a car, pay for insurance, pay for maintainence, pay for parking, pay for gas, it would take years to pay off the debt and even then with all those costs factored in id make hardly anything. 

4. I disagree with this whole point. No country in europe has rolled out UBI yet. No one is recieving enough money to live on for doing nothing. Of course there are always going ro be edge cases, much like the guy in LA buying lobster with his food stamps. And you are right people in higher income stratas in europe will probably pay more in taxes than in the states. In the end the poorest are better off, the middle class has a bit less expendable income, the rich have less money but the impact on their life and happiness is minimal (I'll also add that while many like to complain about taxes, many are willing to give up on owning the newest porsche for last years model if it means that the bottom 20% are able to lead more respectable decent lives), the really rich.. well they avoid paying taxes just like everywhere else.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The only way for someone to change the surroundings is to literally say use a hand and pick up an object, not by belief alone; cannot change anything without any means to actually manipulate what actually exists.

By the way, simply by believing that your brain will increase, by belief alone, is a fallacy, as rather the more logical to explain why occurrence of the brain increases volume; could basically say by simply growing up; such as, a healthy infant brain compared to a healthy adult, the infant's brain is substantially smaller than that of the adult; as also genetics can also be a factor as well.



&amp;nbsp;




As for the idea of 'basic income', which is of the ideas of money and trade; 'money', 'trade'; absolutely does not guarantee say receiving nutrition to live off of; if limited by a belief rather than the definite then there is inefficiency of the distribution of resources; if you do not assess the available resources, and be carelessly using up such resource without regard for the sustainability, then there can easily be famine.



&amp;nbsp;



As for thinking of 'transition' which still utilizes the same exact and inefficient ideas, such as the ideas of 'money','trade', rather than directly applying say a 'resource based economy'; is counterproductive and simply does not change anything; this apparent project will not be beneficial if the same inefficient and backwards beliefs are carried over; which none the less, the illogical beliefs are not scientific and are of fallacy that if believed, is very detrimental to the logical assessment of what actually exists.

 I have personaly been with Jack fresco and Roxane once and know there ideology on RBE and cashless society pretty well.  I agree with your comments and there ideology all the way, except in 2 points: 

1- in order to transition to RBE and cashless society, we must guarantee first ""human basic income/needs"", if this is achieved by using cash or no cash, it needs to be implemented first. Implementing it with no cash is almost impossible at this stage because of human conditioned psychology and global market structures that govern the resources. So our solution is to take advantage of that conditioned psychology and infect the system with a ""virus""  that is designed to change the psychology slowly, with time you can then figure out and implement a cashless society. The ""virus"" I mention is Time Dependent Currency, this currency has a time life of average world life expectancy of 71 years, this currency is also human generated. The combination of these 2 characteristics make financial inequality a mathematical impossibility and guarantees Universal Basic Income ( right to life ) today we only have ( right to have a job, no job no rights to life ). With this guaranteed basic income people can now abandon non serving wage slavery labor, buy abandoning wage slavery, they contribute to a new ethical system without wage slavery using this new currency that is a better alternative to the old one. With time hopefully this new current will takeover the worlds reserve currency and a ""new game will be installed"" a game that is more just, prevents inequality by design and guarantees basis income for all. Now with this new system the global conditioned psychology will start to change. And than we can try a new system... And so on ...

Please have a look at the mathematics supporting my bold claims on time dependent currency:

2 - we have today scientific proof of the impact of consciousness in molding our reality, the double slit experiment is one of them. So in order to accelerate the evolution of this global conditioned psychology to higher levels of consciousness we need to train the mind, this can be done by meditation, it is scientifically proven, it increases brain volume, grey mater density an overall happiness. For references please visit Harvard Medical school data on meditation.
So our approach will be to guarantee basic income through monitoring and validating healthy and mental and physical activity using the sensor. If you hand out free money it will not work, you need to incentives personal growth in order to obtain collective growth ( psychological and consciousness ). Please read more about this on the remarkable work of Ken Willber it is called Spiral dynamics.

But somewhere like the California coast or New York City, it becomes more of a joke. And of course there are exceptions to this minimum too. Smaller companies can pay less. In fact, I've been to some places where servers aren't paid at all by their ""employer"". They live entirely off their tips. Not to mention I've never heard of someone working a full 40 hour week at minimum wage, Well, at one employer that is; so than you get people working two, three, four jobs.

I buy a house, that money goes to the hands of the seller of that house.. that property is helping the economy. I also will pay property tax on that house every year which helps the local government provide education and civil services.

You have also confused corporate with personal income. There are always Tax Havens and loopholes, closing those would require closing the global economy.. how can we tell someone not to bank offshore while allowing trade between other countries?

An investment in a corporation is circulating that money back into the economy. The value of the stock is always included when deciding how much someone is worth, it's not equal to what they invested. The value of stock isn't guaranteed money, it's just a made up number based on what people are paying for it. But, like anything in the market, if they try to offload that stock, it will cause it to be worth less if they own a significant enough number of shares.

As far as how the corporations treat their employees, or how many middle class vs minimum wage people they pay,  that's a whole other situation. But I'll tell you what doesn't help.. our current system of providing food stamps and other assistance creates a system where people are willing to work for less, see Walmart for an example.. Walmart fully supports social programs because they know that money will go right into their pockets and they can pay people less to work for them. I'm not saying those programs shouldn't exist, I'm just saying the more you tax a company and give it back to the poor, the more that company will fuck over it's employees. 

But of course the old goal of the left to fight against automation and preserve work for the people is over, now they want to embrace automation and let the corporate rich provide for all of our needs with UBI, but of course CEOs will love that!

The article discusses the raising gap between per-unit production costs and the retain prices. While in 50s it was around 20%, now it's closer to 60%. If I understand correctly, the cost here includes only the actual production: labor + materials, and does not include marketing and R&amp;D.

This effect can be explained by several different mechanisms (in no particular order):

1. The rising share of investments in R&amp;D. Since the products and services are becoming more high-tech over time, it is quite natural.

2. The rising share of marketing costs. This for example may be correlated with more ways in which a products a starting to be advertised: TV commercials, internet, product placement and so on. I personally find it a bit crazy, but the fact is that every dollar invested in marketing, gives you extra say $2 of income, so it's stupid not to spend tons of money on marketing, until you hit diminishing returns.

3. The cost of production is getting lower due to automation, while the marketing costs might stay the same.

4. In some industries the big players may use monopolist or semi-monopolist status to artificially raise the prices.

5. Some companies (like Coca-Cola) use their well-known brand to sell their products at the higher prices. (This is actually almost the same as 2.)

As you can see, none of these effects can be solved by the introduction of Basic Income.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I am glad that in general I think the idea of loyalty to a particular job or company has been pretty much totally erased in our generation. It makes us harder to take advantage of like is being done to your pops. For those of us lucky enough to have had the advantages to be able to get educated and collect desirable skills it’ll much less painful to jump ship and go somewhere else when a company pisses on us and tells us it’s raining.. 

I also really feel for the people who work in service jobs etc. where it’s sometimes nothing but empty promises and predatory practices anywhere they get hired. To boot there’s a lineup of people behind them desperate for any kind of work so they have no leverage to say fuck you, I don’t need to take this. 

That’s why I’m so in favor of some sort of UBI, we need to give everyone more agency in their own lives, and give people who are being taken advantage of in their jobs the ability to take a stand. If this was widespread enough companies would eventually have to start doing more to incentivize people to want to work there.

It drove me mad this summer when there was all this news being made about how some people were unwilling to go back to work because the unemployment benefits were better than their wage and that was talked about as a sign that the benefits were too generous, and that the people collecting unemployment were lazy.

He's been working at his job for 26+ years. He spent the last year doing crazy amounts of overtime in anticipation of getting a promotion and a hefty raise like he was promised, because he's really intense about his salary, haha. He even redoubled his efforts after two furloughs due to COVID, after which coroporate changed their tune and were begging people to work overtime because the work was so behind. 

Then his company got bought out and not only did they not give him the raise or promotion the buyers promised he would still get, but they *massively* slashed his and his best-performing coworkers' pay by such a significant percentage, made them salary but demanded they work unpaid overtime, cut their paid time off, expanded the amount of traveling they'd have to do to include half the country, cut the reimbursement rate, and let go a ton of employees despite promising not to do that exact thing. 

They measure success in how many ""assistance requests"" you complete, be it pricing something, doing drawings/designs for something, changing the plans, answering questions about pricing, delivery, installation, etc... In the time my dad and his coworker he was having a friendly competition with each did 160 assistance requests, another coworker did four.

The very productive coworker got her salary cut by as much as my dad did, almost 25%. The coworker who was just sitting on Facebook all day, a friend of the manager, got a significant raise, about 15%.

The day they told everyone about these new changes to salaries and benefits was a Friday. They handed them each a contract with a noncompete included and said they had to sign it by Monday or they'd be fired on the spot.

The very productive coworker I mentioned above had been working there 30 years. She found a new job by Monday. Another good friend who got a lot done had been working there 20 years. By Monday, he found a new job with a huge pay/benefits increase (which is awesome because his wife just had their first baby).

My dad has been being scouted by customers ever since, for different work so it won't go against the noncompete, and it really hurts to see him struggle with choosing between the place that's been his family for so long, but which is rapidly losing the people and the environment he so enjoyed... And a job where he's valued and compensated based on how hard he works, because he works extremely hard.

The real value of UBI is to restructure handouts.

The main current source of freebies for people in innercity ghettos are: Low cost rent, direct food assistance, direct monetary assistance.

The degree to which these freebies come in is directly related to their income level. For many recipients, they stand to lose money by working, or the stand to lose time and break even.

The value of UBI is that you can replace a whole bunch of systems which incentivize failure. If the UBI is actually universal, no matter how much money you make, you'll still get UBI, so you're never dis-incentivized to work harder, get a promotion or whatever. I have a friend who moved out of her former housing situation, and into a low cost housing apt. She was working part time at an entry level.

None that I'm aware of, but then again I was saying it is partially dependent on technology and I don't think we've hit the point where it's feasible. Automation (especially AI) + robotics + other technologies could create a perfect storm that leads to democratic socialism. Many experts believe that when this comes around, it will lead to mass unemployment, [meaning either all citizens need to share in the fruits of production (done by the AI/robots)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephen-hawking-capitalism-robots_5616c20ce4b0dbb8000d9f15), or we'll see massive amounts of starvation or worse as only the few who control production get richer (much like our current situation in how our billionaire class is moving towards owning more and more of the wealth in this nation) while the rest get poorer. 

Related to this concept, some [Scandinavian countries](http://qz.com/473779/several-dutch-cities-want-to-give-residents-a-no-strings-attached-basic-income/) are already starting to experiment with [universal basic income](http://www.vice.com/read/something-for-everyone-0000546-v22n1). People get a regular stipend which is enough to live off of, then if you get a job you get all the money from your job + the universal basic income. Does basic income by itself give you enough to buy all the gadgets you might want or buy entertainment/non essentials? Not at all, but it's enough to ensure that you don't live on the street and don't have to worry about whether you can afford food this week or not. In this sense, most people suspect that people will continue to work despite getting the bare minimum to live. 

I don't really consider Stephen Hawking an expert on this subject, but he did seem to echo what I've read elsewhere in regards to AI's potential impacts on our society. Plus even just with [car automation](http://fortune.com/2015/10/16/how-tesla-autopilot-learns/) (not real AI, just automation + machine leaning) coming so quick, it's [easy to see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjxyBMA6lXI) how this will displace tens of thousands or more from their current jobs, taxis, truckers, buses, etc.

&gt;I think he can get around it. All he has to do is say that social democracy is the term that more accurately reflects his ideology and clarify that he does not intend on doing away with capitalism like many seem to think.

I don't think it'll be that simple, I'm pretty sure that if he said that he's a social democrat and stops using the words socialist and democratic socialist (words that have literally been used to define him in the mainstream media) he will face a drop in the polls as people will suspect he doesn't understand the definitions of these terms and doesn't know what he is or what he wants for America. Plus the socialist part is out of the bag, republicans have already been trying to compare him to the Nazis. I doubt they'll stop after he says he's not a socialist (Obama never claimed to be one and he's still called it every day by one republican politician or another). They'll probably just accuse him of being a deviant socialist who's now trying to hide the fact that he's a socialist who's here to destroy America, or something along those lines.

But I agree that he should make clear that he doesn't want to end capitalism in any way. I do wish that he kind of started his campaign calling himself a social democrat. I'm not sure that would have created the same buzz as him calling himself a socialist, which might have been important in differentiating himself from the other candidates, but it would lead to less attacks later on when people try to compare him to the Soviet Union or the Nazis (well maybe, after all people call Obama a socialist and some like Ben Carson compare Obamacare to Nazi Germany).","Taxonomy:

Alright you better appreciate this reply. :d

&gt; We have some problems with GDP as a measure. But even assuming those away, is nominal GDP the right measure to compare to interest rates? Interest rates, like all monetary policy, have to be determined with reference to the inflation rate, and our policy objectives.

Nominal GDP includes real growth which is not something I'd just hand out to money owners. I tend to look at nominal GDP to get an idea about money stock.


&gt; If there's inflation, higher nominal GDP is not a pass to ignore it.

True. Nominal GDP is just real growth plus inflation after all. And I mean you calculate real growth and inflation from nominal GDP, I think.


&gt; To some extent, inflation-minded policy implies we are promising to let nominal indicators temporarily take a hit, if necessary, so that those nominal indicators remain indicative of real conditions.

Also a tax on owning money but sure. Though I happen to want a tax on owning money because I think it supports better development and is moral.

​
&gt; Be careful of this. The BoE article does have some language like this-- stressing monetary quantities, and talking about things like ""affecting the stock of broad money."" But it's also clear that what they're not doing is attempting to match interest rates to monetary quantities or vice versa.

They're looking to at least reference aggregate nominal spending (which might not include corporate income related things but not sure). Hopefully not 1:1. But yeah good reminder.

&gt; They're attempting to maintain price stability, and any manipulation of monetary quantities is just a tool to affect spending, which is the causal part. Monetary quantities, at best, ""may contain information about current spending.""

&gt; That's an important insight, and the language of the BoE paper doesn't fully account for it. If central bankers fully understood the Income Theory of Money and its implications, then we wouldn't need to be discussing possible revisions to their framework.

Indeed.
​
&gt; I don't really think of QE that way, and to be clear, I did not share the BoE article to endorse all models in it, but rather to establish the basics of monetary policy, as they're currently thought about.

The article seems to assume that lower interest rate is a simple instrument that tends to lead to more investment/spending. Unless I'm missing something. I wouldn't say that this is the current level of academic insight on that point, from that publication. It makes some good points where it references research but I couldn't find anything on the interest rate thing in there. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough? Can I get a quote that comes with a relevant source inside of the publication?
​
&gt; &gt; What kind of rate are we actually setting, when we set rate to exceed nominal spending growth?

&gt; A rate which is intended to curb nominal spending, to bring it back in line with real production, so that nominal spending continues to = real spending going into the future.

An interest rate that exceeds nominal spending growth implies giving owners of money collectively all the productivity growth and a full adjustment to inflation, too. Not really something we're looking to do I think. Could get self-referencial.

Again I seem to see the real risk of this going off rails if it's the main thing you do in an attempt to manage money supply. Why would you use this tool for that, anyway? It's not intuitive to do so. And it is politically loaded like much of anything you could do. People play a game of pretend that it isn't? I guess. In the first place I have concerns about its fitness for purpose anyhow. But to keep that game of pretend alive, you might have to opt for less direct means to get to your benefactors what they want. And you might not even notice the ideological tint to the thing. There's a reason funding is focused on the theories of economics that tend to say that governments mostly just need to balance their budgets and everything is well in the world.

&gt; If Turkey's productive economy is suffering, monetary policy on its own can't rescue the real economy. What it can do is adjust nominal spending, if stable prices requires it.

If Turkey's productive economy is not suffering, then that is that, however, and I have no reason to believe that Turkey's productive economy is suffering (yet). Also the productive economy could suffer from rate hikes, so if anything we might get a problem with cause and effect here, even if we find evidence for Turkey's economy to suffer right now.

And interest rate policy can and usually does have an inverse effect to the usually intended one, no? I've not (yet) heard of a plausible theory that would undermine that point. We might not have a clear idea on time-frame, rate and level at which this occurs, yet, so let us look at the empirical evidence with a fresh mind.

&gt; If Turkey is worried about higher inflation, they can curb it with higher rates.

That is still a fantastical view based on fantastical assumptions as far as I'm aware.

&gt; Today, like most countries, they're probably worrying about full employment instead, and that does put your economy in a bit of a pickle.

Full employment is the easy to achieve. I'm not huge on the JG (without UBI) because there's more important things to do than job, at times. People should to school their moral compasses and act from there. There's a cost to full employment, sure. We're using rather lackluster means trying to achieve full employment, too.

&gt; I may have introduced confusion by linking you to the BoE paper, because now instead of talking about whether lower rates make banks more or less likely to lend, we're talking about how that affects the ""stock of broad money."" Which I don't think is a useful indicator.

Indeed the paper doesn't seem to support interest rates being a simple policy lever that only ever works in one direction. Don't you see that any dollar you add with interest rates, today, is someone's income to speculate with and spend? It cannot be a net negative to business outlook as such, at least over time to de-leverage old debt with it. The way that interest rates can depress investment is based on the adjustment from a lower to a higher rate. While over time it runs against that. I've not seen a publication that disuptes that from empiric evidence or that would propose that we can ignore that.​

&gt; &gt; From what I gathered, the assumption is that Volcker style interest rate policy will likely support a higher UBI.

&gt; It's more nuanced than that. If we're at the limits of tightening, higher rates can't deliver us a higher real UBI.

I consider 'tightening' to be inflationary over time in the first place. Give banks a simple business of passing through interest rates to consumers with money in the bank. And the big banks don't need much of the added reserves they got from QE after all. They'll have less reserves but more business...

What the banks needed QE to do was hold up prices of e.g. collateralized mortgages/real estate and government bond valuations of e.g. EU states that purchased a lot of collateralized mortgages soon after 2008. Or their books would've said they're bankrupt. This is part of why there's such a housing glut all over the world. QE was a measure also to inhibit the purchasing of things by artificially keeping prices up. Now that was that, and a QE 4 the people could help us access the overpriced stuff without crashing the economy. Interestingly enough the FED is also looking into this actively.

&gt; The discussion about why present conditions have room for tightening, have more to do with the question of full employment, wages, and whether jobs are an efficient way to distribute income to people.

That too. Also with vast oversupply of real estate and other (investment) goods. As much as I'd prefer we lead inflation from the bottom up, so instead of luxury appartments we get more functional appartments. Whoever's spending leads inflation has an important impact on what is being built. (edit: Do note that some things may not show up in inflation, like availability of the supposed affordable option may simply be gone in favor of more high end.)","Money and inflation, Economic systems, Taxes.",gi6cr0l,"&gt;The BoE article you linked (edit: [this one](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/money-creation-in-the-modern-economy.pdf)) seems to be more of a public facing official line to justify the state of interest rates.

\[EDIT\] Something I'd like to hear more from you about, is what you think normal interest rates or interest rate policy ought to look like.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Either way nominal GDP growth is the thing that I'd focus on to understand whether or not there's enough money going around to match or exceed the interest rate.

We have some problems with GDP as a measure. But even assuming those away, is nominal GDP the right measure to compare to interest rates? Interest rates, like all monetary policy, have to be determined with reference to the inflation rate, and our policy objectives.

If there's inflation, higher nominal GDP is not a pass to ignore it. To some extent, inflation-minded policy implies we are promising to let nominal indicators temporarily take a hit, if necessary, so that those nominal indicators remain indicative of real conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;whether or not there's enough money going around to match or exceed the interest rate.

Be careful of this. The BoE article does have some language like this-- stressing monetary quantities, and talking about things like ""affecting the stock of broad money."" But it's also clear that what they're ***not*** doing is attempting to match interest rates to monetary quantities or vice versa.

They're attempting to maintain price stability, and any manipulation of monetary quantities is just a tool to affect spending, which is the causal part. Monetary quantities, at best, *""may contain information about current spending.""*

That's an important insight, and the language of the BoE paper doesn't fully account for it. If central bankers fully understood the Income Theory of Money and its implications, then we wouldn't need to be discussing possible revisions to their framework.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'd be careful about buying into models that propose that QE is an inflationary measure.

I don't really think of QE that way, and to be clear, I did not share the BoE article to endorse all models in it, but rather to establish the basics of monetary policy, as they're currently thought about.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What kind of rate are we actually setting, when we set rate to exceed nominal spending growth?

A rate which is intended to curb nominal spending, to bring it back in line with real production, so that nominal spending continues to = real spending going into the future.

If Turkey's productive economy is suffering, monetary policy on its own can't rescue the real economy. What it can do is adjust nominal spending, if stable prices requires it.

That on its own is not a sufficient objective. Just because prices are stable, does not mean people are better off, or the economy's output is increasing. It just means we steer away from a hyperinflationary episode.

If Turkey is worried about higher inflation, they can curb it with higher rates. If they're worried about achieving full output / full prosperity? They have to tweak their fiscal policy.

Today, like most countries, they're probably worrying about full employment instead, and that does put your economy in a bit of a pickle.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I ask myself: ""Are we creating conditions conductive to doing business well?"" Because that leads to more product, less inflation pressure. Is the high rate causing good business conditions?

Agreed.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This seems like unsound speculation given 'lower interest rates' is meant with looser stance on monetary policy. The source for the statement refers to broad money changes being useful indicators (which I agree with as I tend to look at nominal GDP growth for a number of things; edit: added/cleaned this up), not that low interest rates would produce the expansion of broad money stock. (edit: beyond a short run bubble.)

I may have introduced confusion by linking you to the BoE paper, because now instead of talking about whether lower rates make banks more or less likely to lend, we're talking about how that affects the ""stock of broad money."" Which I *don't* think is a useful indicator.

If it were up to me, the BoE article would never mention stocks except to emphasize their irrelevancy. \[EDIT\] Central banks were not ready to go that far in 2014. There are leanings in that direction now.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;From what I gathered, the assumption is that Volcker style interest rate policy will likely support a higher UBI.

It's more nuanced than that. If we're at the limits of tightening, higher rates *can't* deliver us a higher real UBI.

The discussion about why present conditions have room for tightening, have more to do with the question of full employment, wages, and whether jobs are an efficient way to distribute income to people. There's a larger model here, and I wasn't attempting to imply that understanding contemporary monetary policy models is sufficient to accept the CMT claims about this.

The reason why rate hikes can work in the context of UBI, isn't because they control inflation, but because tighter lending conditions specifically diminishes banks' &amp; shadow-banks' hold on resources via the businesses their lending supports.

CMT makes the case that we're currently using unnecessary, unproductive job creation as an excuse to funnel wages to people, and these jobs are all supported by an excessively stimulated financial sector. Supported not just by low rates, but also by central bank asset purchases and other tools.

These jobs on life support use up resources which otherwise could have been put to use by productive firms, producing goods consumers want to buy. This way of getting consumers money-- through firm labor costs-- wastes a very large amount of resources, and people's time. Freeing up those resources is what allows the rate hikes to ultimately translate into a higher real UBI.

I could be misinterpreting you, but I think you're trying to make the case that rate hikes won't actually diminish lending, and/or you suspect they would affect productive jobs just as much as unproductive jobs?

I'd disagree with the former (by referring to contemporary central bank liteature), but I'd agree with the latter-- assuming we're talking about an economy with $0 UBI. When Volcker raises rates in a full employment paradigm, he may successfully curb inflation, but at the cost of creating real poverty for many people.

Once you have a positive rate of UBI, the tighter selection pressure on firms from the lending end, can be offset by more abundant consumer spending. Then it's just a question of how far you can realistically push that, which is certainly not infinitely far.

Your first set of questions is like if we just decided today that machines will handle everything. I'm talking about a process by which we increase human labor toward the efforts of automation so that a lot of that is handled automatically in the future, with limited or no intervention.

Who says machines/robots/AI/whatever can't (eventually) diagnose illness or tend wounds? Who says they can't build when there are already 3D printed homes? 

Psychology and philosophy may be outside the bounds of automation, and probably should be, but those are the important kind of roles that would/could still exist regardless because people care about other people and doing this kind of labor. It just wouldn't be labor that's tied to whether or not they get to live via paychecks.

People could do what they wanted. Make art, be a psychologist, whatever.

There really are people who never want to work another day in their life, but there's probably not that many people that will feel self-fulfilled if they spend their days glued to the couch and the TV or PC.

People really can get bored of that shit if they're given the freedom to just do it all the time. They'll want to do that thing they always wanted to do but couldn't because they had to be tied down to a specific location and a specific job and stuff.

There are ways to achieve it in the capitalist framework, but if you're profitable to the point of not needing to work anymore, what about the people that work for you, if there are any? Do they not deserve the freedom that you got if they spent the same 5 years working? Aren't they integral to providing the value that your business provides?

If there aren't any workers under you, what about if there are any other areas of exploitation? Someone's handing you money for your service/product. Are they kinda getting ripped off? Is there a reason other than you needing the money that you couldn't provide the service for free or cheaper?

I don't think this is correct.  The optimal level of basic income has very little to do with the measure of global GDP.  When you distribute a basic income to people, some of that money goes toward the purchase of additional economic output, which would actually increase global GDP.  Some of it might also go toward the purchase of financial assets etc. that aren't factored into GDP calculations.

The only way to know the appropriate level of basic income is to gradually ramp it up over time until we stop getting additional benefit when we increase it.  But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that $14,000 somehow happens to be the optimal amount we settle on.  This doesn't prevent people from getting additional income from elsewhere.

Most dollars are created by markets, by private financial firms. The state taxes those created dollars for revenue but why not just create more public dollars; you can fund a basic income, even worldwide, with a fraction of the amount the private financial sector creates.

&gt; We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.

 As Tibio suggested, the problem is the greed of the rich. Or maybe you could say the problem is an overly capitalist culture which in the long run creates selection pressure primarily towards human exploitation. Allow unrestrained competition and who's going to compete best? Those with more power to exert their will (money). So you get a self reinforcing cycle of power accumulation by those with an insatiable lust for power and a willingness to do whatever they can to feed it. Of course it has to come at the expense of the rest of us. There's only so much to go around.

So under the current system we can expect that the future will include us getting more and more screwed over if we want to be a part of this society. There are other possible societies we could form. Guaranteed basic income is what you seem to be getting at. The basic idea here is that there are certain rights we should recognize as basic to being human, and those include a recognition that we all should have enough personal power to survive, just because human life is precious, or because compassion is our ideal, or at least because we might find ourselves on the bottom soon enough. We should all have enough power to be fed and sheltered from the elements, at least minimally, even if we can't compete against the more powerful to get it otherwise. (check out /r/basicincome)

There's enough to go around, or at least what there is could go around in a much more humane way, but the system as it has evolved doesn't consider humaneness or compassion as important as a person's right to accumulate as much as they can within certain perfunctory legal guidelines. And it's just going to get worse unless something drastic is done. Automation has allowed unprecedented rises in productivity, but the average work week keeps getting longer. Profits are rising, but that's not being reflected in rises in wages or jobs in the way you would expect in a system meant to work for humanity, only as you would expect in a system meant to work for the greed riding on their backs. Our system is rotten at the core because we fell for the idea that greed could result in fairness if done right.

In my view the first step to fixing this is to get corporate money out of politics, to get rid of corporate personhood. (See the documentary [The Corporation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/22mwzv/the_corporation_the_pathological_pursuit_of/) for a good explanation as to why this is preventing other things from getting done.) And in my view the two best resources we have for doing that are [The Wolf PAC](http://www.wolf-pac.com) and [Mayday PAC](https://mayday.us). The former assumes corporations have too much control at the federal level and is trying to go over their head at the local level by calling for a state's constitutional convention on the issue.

Capitalism  somewhat oppresses wage earners because it's not as easy to start a competing business.  If people have the resources to do this, jobs can be created. People create jobs, not just some fictional capitalist creature or something.

Our system is damn inefficient at allocating resources to maximim utility. We still need an incentive system for working. That's always going to stay.  We waste so much labor doing low value work because that's the jobs that are created. If more people have money to spend or time to do other things, they will decide what they value economically.

The problem with people is they can't imagine a world where working is optional.  So, instead we create make-work projects for lots of people in companies and elsewhere, because they create value right? In some cases yes, in many others no. 

Many people like working, and improving their life. No question there. I actually believe that basic income will increase employment, not reduce it. Basic income ensures that demand for jobs will exist, because people will have more money to spend. Basic income is a jobs program. It's not a centralized authority deciding what to do though, It's people working more for each other creating value, rather than some large corporation or government agency dishing out spending in a autocratic manner. 

This is what people don't understand about trade and economics. If labor stops being scarce, then it's possible to increase the productivity of labor just by having increased demand through greater spending. Inflation is always an issue, but it can manged. It's been managed fine for a long time. Deflation seems to be a larger issue these days.

A tepid economy, slow productivity growth, wealth inequality. These are all problems created by the established system. I am totally against  communism in terms of property and capital, central planning , and all that crap. Capitalism should not be narrowly defined by the neoliberal model which has endured for past 40 years. Capitalism has many possible variants if only we can imagine how to make a better system.

My other, more serious concern with basic income is that it would not get rid of all jobs. It would just get rid of a sizable portion of them, be it a minority or majority. What happens to the rest?  
Instead of removing income inequality it'd deepen it as its simply unfair for some to work hard and get a comparable size of money while the rest do nothing. They would require way more compensation comparatively and they would do a lot to keep it that way.  
It's seductive to think the transition will be a smooth one between all eligible people working to none, but this will breed tension, spike crime and increase debt even further as consequence of trying to fix the situation. The last employers will be the ones to benefit most from the situation, realistically speaking.  
I don't see Basic income as a means of removing employment as there will always be someone willing to earn money for some work, merely as a more flexible alternative to minimum wage.

This is very curious. Do you think that some social groups are under- or overrepresented in executive positions due to external, non-commercial factors like racism or discrimination?

Racial %of workers in executive positions is representative of population only when the population itself is overwhelmingly homogeneous, like Japan. Throughout history various social groups almost everywhere had different rates of social success. Discrepancies in outcomes among different groups are a rule, not an exception.

57,"1. I had a short lunch, so I went into the Migros (grocery store) bought some bread, meat and cheese and made my self a sandwich, it was pleasant although a bit tough. For dinner I made a mushroom risotto, it was slightly over cooked, but still pleasant and paired it with some wine I had lying around. I felt really classy, eventhough I was basically in my Pyjama.

2. I'd probably go with [this picture](https://www.srf.ch/var/storage/images/_aliases/944w/auftritte/news/bilder/a403ecc8ce34a9bdd8e9941c6394b339/52622230-3-ger-DE/a403ecc8ce34a9bdd8e9941c6394b339.jpg). It shows a truck dumping about 8 million 0.05 franc pieces on the Bundesplatz (the square in front of the government building in Bern) to protest for a unconditional basic income... The initiative failed, by the way.

3. The relations with the EU... On one hand our economy needs the EU, on the other hand we want to be as independent as possible. It means we're constantly in a limbo.

Melting glaciers... Due to global warming our glaciers start to melt, well, not only the glaciers but also the perma frost. This can lead to catastrophic results like giant rock slides of [these proportions](http://f.hikr.org/files/315530l.jpg) which is pretty bad.

High prices... Switzerland is expensive pretty much everyone knows that. This has two major downsides, one, beeing a tourist in Switzerland is quite challenging since you'll need a lot more money than in other countries and two, people in the border regions don't buy their things in Switzerland that much, they mostly cross the border and just buy it in as an example Germany.

4. Germany: F*cking Schwaabesäck!!! Germans are the biggest immigrant group in Switzerland, and especially in the Swiss German parts their influence is strong. Yet, I don't recommend calling a Swiss, German. We beat them in wars a couple of times and have been a bit more scary than usual in the last 100 years. Otherwise they're quite OK.

France: Basically like Germany but French. They had a huge influence on our western cantons and basically were the reason the modern Swiss state was created. We had a secret military agreement during WW2 which would have made them the closest thing we had to an ally in WW2. Otherwise we're still kinda salty they beat us at the battle of Marignano and then they broke the eternal peace agreement which is also kinds not so nice.

Austria: Our history with Austria is... Complicated to say the least. Originally Switzerland was created in a rebellion against the Austrian Habsburg monarchs. We fought many wars against them and they always were this kind of enemy figure in the past. Nowadays we're quite good friends though, we're both Alpine countries and Austrian culture also influenced the German cantons. All in all, it's kinda like we're on a rebound with our ex.

Italy: Ah, the extension of Ticino... Due to the Gotthard tunnel travel to Italy became a lot faster, which made it even more attractive as a holiday destination. Their workers helped us a lot during the industrialisation and are still a large foreigner group, although a lot of them integrate into the Swiss population seamlessly now.

Liechtenstein: Ah, little Liechtenstein... It's basically our little sister. We share a lot culturally and even if they are a monarchy, we still love them a lot.

5. The most popular one is probably that the Bernese people talk extremely slow and the Valais people can't be understood.

6. It varies greatly from person to person, I'm pretty good with languages so I understand pretty much everything. German and French are my strongest though.

7. So I've recently been there and if I had to say my first thoughts now... Pleasantly surprised, beautiful cities, the people are friendly and try to help you with your pronounciation. Also, lots and lots of empty land.

8. I'd probably go with Andre Beguin... He was the commander of the Wauwilermoos internment camp and basically turned it into a wanna be concentration camp where he treated interned soldiers like dirt... He also was a Nazi sympathizer.

9. I'd go with Henri Dunant, the founder of the red cross... The reason is probably self explanatory... Best living Swiss... Bertrand Piccard, together with his own family he managed to do amazing things in pushing the boundaries.

10. Switzerlands gun culture is very old and mostly based around military weapons, I guess it comes down to training and why you have the weapon... To defend the country and not yourself.

3. Could you name few (e.g. three) things being major long-term problems Switzerland is facing currently? 

4. What do you think about neighboring countries? Both seriously and stereotypical. 

5. What are some local (cantonal?) or regional (language?) stereotypes among Swiss?

6. What's level of profficiency between languages? How many German-speaking Swiss know French or Italian, and how many non-German speaking (first language) speak German as well, as second language. Could e.g. someone from Zürich easily communicate in Geneve or Ticino? Or do you maybe use English in such case?

7. What do you know about Poland? First thoughts please.

8. Worst Swiss ever? I'm asking about most despicable characters in your history (not serial killers etc.). You can pick more than one, of course.

9. Following question - best Swiss ever? Also, best living Swiss (compatriot figures you respect or are proud of)?

10. Switzerland is often given by supporters of gun ownership, as an example of country mixing high level of it with low rate of problems related to this (like crime). I strongly suppose you're rather an exception to the rule, but nevertheless - what are the reasons of this (good) situation?

11. What triggers or ""butthurts"" (stereotypes, history, myths) Swiss a lot? Our example would be [Polish death camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Polish_death_camp%22_controversy).

12. Could you recommend some good movies (or TV series) made in Swtzerland, especially recently? 

13. How does your neighborhood / street look? You shouldn't post your actual location obviously, anything similar would be OK (e.g. Street View).

14. Swiss cuisine - what's best, and what's weirdest?

15. How does your political system work? Who are your leaders? Do you even have leaders?

First FoPo. To most people that means war so I'll copy paste straight from the horses mouth.

""I have a 3-part test for deploying our armed forces:

Does it serve a vital American national interest? Alternatively, does it avert a humanitarian crisis?

Is there a clear timeline and end date?

Are our allies and partners engaged and ready to join us?

If these 3 elements are satisfied then I would be prepared to move forward. At every turn though my preference is to work in tandem with Congress and the American people. The Constitution clearly places the ability to declare war with Congress. These last 18 years Congress has ceded this authority to the executive branch through the AUMF. That is not right. If we send our young men and women of the armed forces into harm’s way it should be consistent with the will of the people as reflected through Congressional authority.""

For other foreign policy he has said a lot but it all boils down to one.

We need to stop acting like we are the world police and quite meddling in others affairs. Also we need to counter China not through tariffs and trade wars, but by becoming the top producer of green energies.

Little else has been released beyond they above. FoPo is obviously his weakest point however his demeanor has left little room to doubt he has no problem doing exactly what a president should do. Surround himself with incredibly smart people that are experts in a diverse array of subjects then considering their advice when making decisions.

Next flash in the pan. 

He has stated he would be around for as long as is necessary to push for his objectives. Many take that to mean if he's not elected this time then he will run again. While I personally don't think he will run again his passion on the subject and his insane ability to push his agenda to the forefront of his competitors campaigns gives me the confidence to say he won't stop advocating in some meaningful form until his vision is accomplished. Automation was just a buzzword before Yang, climate change was a 2 choice option before Yang, UBI wasn't even on anyone's radar despite multiple big time names like Elon talking about and the 4th industrial revolution is now a household phrase.

As to a failed campaign, you speak as if it's a forgone conclusion whereas I see his victory the same way, or close to it. The world as a whole is fighting back against corruption on a scale as yet unseen. Trump legitimized the internet campaign, and Yang is utilizing the lessons learned and capitalizing on it to a level none has ever seen before.

Absolutely everything I have seen up to this point shows me an eventual success on his part. He has managed to mix ""The Tipping Point"" policy with military insurgency/guerrilla recruiting tactics and it's working exactly as it should. Not a single deadline has been missed that is projected by those two trains of thought and honestly I am surprised no one ever thought of marrying the two before.

It's the perfect strategy for creating a grassroots campaign. Even when I thought he made a miss step or disagreed with his actions I have been proven wrong and got to watch another domino fall in the long chain reaction that needs to take place to put him in the White House.

Look at the end of the day I'm trying to figure out from you guys if you think he's a push for actual change or he's a flash thats going to disappear. I have two friends, one whose apolitical and just recently discovered Yang and the other who is probably just as nihilistic about politics these days as I am.

If they do this, at that point there is no backing out or changing their mind (unless some extra info learned later invalidates the circumstance under which they agreed to sign the contract), but signing that contract should be equally as freely optional as the mother's choice to opt out of abortion.

The thing with these ideas is that they are too easy to abuse. A man could simply decline to sign even if he does intend to be an involved father, and then he could piss off at any time because he never signed his life away. Basically why would he? Men could just keep their options open and screw the woman over with all the responsibility. Also, shouldn't the mom also have to sign this intention as well? I think it should be separate from the medical decision of abort vs. pregnancy - a separate thing, a parenting responsibility decision. Although typically it's more likely the woman would be choosing to raise the baby and the man choosing not, it does go the other way sometimes, the woman giving birth but the dad being the parent, while the mom only pays child support. I think the policies would have to be as gender-neutral as possible. Child support is a gender neutral policy (as in -- non-custodial mothers also have to pay child support if the other parent is raising the kid) it's just nature that is unbalanced and there's no fixing that (although, as a woman, I'd be sooo thrilled if I could never get pregnant, but I'm lapsing into fantasy land here). Not saying the laws are all perfect or anything. Also depends a lot where you live I imagine.

BTW just to be clear I do like the concept in theory of being able to give up parental rights before birth. Or some kind of opt in or opt out system. I can just never think of one that seems like it would fit most scenarios in a way that isn't ultra-abusable.

87,"For me, the interpretation gets pretty nuanced, but I think UBI is a net improvement over the status quo:

A UBI doesn't replace working income per se, so much as provide a guaranteed FLOOR of income which isn't tied to a particular employer. A person who choses to work even the lowest-paying job is still going to be in a better financial position than their UBI-only compatriot who stays home.

Today - many social benefits spontaneously disappear if you cross a line and are ""no longer poor enough"", creating dis-incentives for taking on more work. When talking about UBI, I think people fail to comprehend how messed up and convoluted our existing safety nets are, such that a UBI can actually help align incentives for working, and a person improving their prospects/value in the economy.

Some people can live like monks but, most want luxuries and indulgences which a UBI would never sufficiently cover.

Many people suffer dehumanizing, socially toxic and physically unsafe workplaces which exploit the workers. I have no doubts that businesses operating on such a basis would be forced to change their business practices and compensation models.

IMO - Our laws should ensure that consumers see and pay the true costs of goods, where many of our decisions are distorted through subsidies and externalities.

Going back to your example of fruit picking - At the end of the day what would such a change mean? Perhaps some people don't choose to stay as fruit pickers under the current wages, and employers in the market have to find ways to be more attractive for pickers... Some customers would probably willing to pay more for fruit, and some won't - a new equilibrium would need to be reached.

The 3 farmers get run out of business. The factory is already out of business and was bought buy a realty company to be converted into luxury apartments. No one has any where to work but Wal Mart. They work there 28 to 32 hours a week getting $8 an hour. And then they go home. Well how can they afford there home? How can they afford food for them and there 2 kids. How can they afford babysitting? Who pays for Lil Susie when she gets sick or needs preventative care like Vaccinations. Who pays for the employee when catches a strong version of seasonal flu?

Well rather than Wall Mart pay for benefits and a better wage. They count on their workers to stay in town and still stay breathing buy allowing the government to foot the bill on affordable housing units. The government gives them the Snap program. The government. The government used to offer after school programs so the parents didn't have to pay for a baby sitter but that's dried up. The government provides medicaid to little Susie. But when Mom gets sick, she has to call in sick and miss hours and may go to the emergency room if it gets really bad than skip the bill.


It's an untenable system. And if there were no government intervention, people would have to find a way to move to even more rural areas for more affordable housing. Then Wal Mart wouldn't have a big enough pool of workers and would have to provide more pay and benefits to attract workers.

But we're left with a catch 22. Because Wall Mart alre already conquered the rural areas so there's no where for workers to go.

if you doubled everyones income, including bill gates.. yeah inflation will double and nothing will change.

employees add another 1 buck. I take home 5 bucks because I am the boss and i like that.

The author laid out a rather compelling case in favor of it, which puts them way to the left of just about any ""mainstream"" party I'm aware of.

The argument was essentially, if people have a consistent source of income, then there is a constant source of consumer demand. Economies would not spiral down as much because layoffs wouldn't necessarily lead to more layoffs (at least, not at the same rate) if those laid off knew they would have money coming in from the government. It would also allow more people the ability to get more educated or tinker with a new idea in their downtime, making it more likely in a quickly changing economy they remain employable. It would also replace most social saftey net programs, simplifying the process significantly. And if it were paid for by a higher corporate and high income tax rate, those who benefit most from automation will be the ones financing the alleviation to the turbulence it will likely unleash.

They of course end with the caveat that to pay for it western nations would first have to find a solution to tax shelters, and there really isn't a simple one since every nation is sovereign and there will always be a few with lax laws to draw in companies.

So I kind of bristle when people call the Economist right wing, because it opened my eyes to what I think will probably only look mainstream left in 10+ years when automation really gets into high gear. Center for American Progress recently put out a proposal that's getting towards there, creating essentially a guarantee to a job by creating ""employment of last resort"" fields where anyone without a job can get a job from the government doing some kind of basic government service 100% guaranteed.

133,"I've been pondering this for quite some time, even though I tend to lean heavily in an anarchist direction and I fully realize that it's not terribly consequential.  I'm quite a geek about researching American third-party politics--it's one of my quirky little interests, and in the process I've become quite knowledgeable of little far-leftist parties in the US.  I also think it's fine for anarchists to vote, want to cast a protest vote, registered so I could vote for state amendments and local ballot initiatives, etc., etc., so for many reasons I'm voting in the presidential election this year despite my convictions.

By far my favorite socialist party in the US is the [Freedom Socialist Party](http://www.socialism.com).  It's a (non-Pathfinder) Trotskyist organization that comes closest to my personal views--it's pretty explicitly anti-tankie for the most part, openly critical of other leftist parties for their tacit support of despotic/authoritarian regimes under the banner of ""anti-imperialism"", and seems to have the strongest emphasis on feminism (though, extremely controversially for a socialist I'm sure, I disagree with their assertion that class is more fundamental than gender oppression--probably not an issue for 99% of this sub, though).  I also personally appreciate that they've published essays by Jewish socialists and explicitly spoken out against anti-Semitism in the course of their anti-Zionist/pro-Palestinian activism, something which bothers me greatly that other leftist parties are largely silent on.  Additionally, they've actually expressed openness to working/allying with anarchists!

They ran a write-in ticket in 2012 I wish I would've voted for, but unfortunately this year they're not running anyone.  Instead, they're endorsing [Socialist Action's](https://socialistaction.org/2016/07/12/socialist-action-campaign-platform-2016/) write-in ticket of Jeff Mackler and Karen Schraufnagel.  Their campaign looks promising, but the platform is a tad vague and I honestly don't know enough about their organization or the candidates themselves.

In addition to the parties OP has listed, there's also the Socialist Worker's Party, which publishes *The Militant* and is running longtime union activist [Alyson Kennedy](http://www.themilitant.com/SWPCampaign2016/swpcampaign2016.html) for president.  They're definitely Pathfinder, and have generally been extremely, explicitly supportive of the Cuban government from what I garner, something that distinguishes them a bit from other parties.  

I'm not voting for Kennedy, mainly because the SWP has recently made some extremely disturbing TERF-y statements regarding trans bathroom access, and her campaign has explicitly discouraged protests of Trump rallies and generally been far too soft on ""working-class"" Trump supporters with a twisted logic that's beyond bizarre.  The main problem with the SWP, as far as I can tell, is that it seems to have this ridiculously simplistic/fetishistic fixation on ""workers"" that extends even beyond ideology, to the point of basically forgiving/giving a pass to misguided right-wing populist sentiment among the disaffected working class, just because it's coming from ""working people"" or whatever.

Personally, I've decided to vote for **Gloria La Riva**.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a big fan of the PSL--they're honestly a bit shady with respect to their interactions with other leftist parties, perhaps the most tankie-heavy of the bunch, have been widely accused of being neo-Stalinist, and there are consequently many issues I vehemently disagree with them over, but as an individual candidate, La Riva seems like the strongest with the most thoroughly-articulated platform of the far left this year.  I admire a lot of her activism as an individual, as well, and just find her to be the most well-grounded and likable candidate (aside from the 'anti-imperialist' tankie nonsense, which she doesn't seem to be focusing on too heavily in this campaign anyway) overall.  Her campaign seems most explicitly focused on economic issues such as expanding benefits, minimum wage and basic income, which are very important to me in a presidential candidate, with a well-rounded, solid track record of activism around immigrant rights and the anti-war movement, which is great.

The PSL seems to run pretty solid individual candidates despite the issues with the party itself--I'm also rather fond of Peta Lindsay, and Eugene Puryear and Dennis Banks (La Riva's running mates this year) seem alright.

The WWP, from which I believe the PSL originally split, has similar issues, and it really bothers me that Moorehead has explicitly spoken out in favor of the DPRK, with shocking naivety even for a member of a party with pro-authoritarian/tankie tendencies.  Regardless, it's not on the ballot in my state.  

Stein isn't explicitly socialist enough to garner my protest vote, her lightly disingenuous pandering to anti-vaxxers bugs me, and I guess the way I see it is that as long as I'm protest voting, I might as well vote for a party that's actually, radically socialist.  (I also particularly want to vote for a female presidential candidate this election cycle, as a sort of extra protest against the liberals'/neocons' excitement over the inevitable election of ""the first woman president!!!!!!1"".  :P)

Of course I care greatly about both racial justice and environmental issues, but the WWP and Green campaigns, respectively, seem *too* heavily focused on those individual issues for my taste, honestly.  A lot of Stein's Green New Deal stuff seems heavily bureaucratic, invokes capitalist rhetoric, and is just...ehh...

The TL;DR here, I suppose, is that from my point of view, most all of the far-left parties in the US have major issues, and I prefer to base my protest votes/support on the individual candidates they're running and what specifically happens in their campaigns.  Honestly I think the whole idea of throwing united support behind one of the small socialist parties in the US is a bit silly and futile anyway.  If you're going to protest vote as a socialist, I don't see an issue with just deciding based on individual ideological preferences and the individual candidates, because all of the US leftist parties (from an anarcho-communist/left communist/libertarian socialist perspective, at least) have some glaring major issue or another.  This election I'm voting for Gloria La Riva as a radical 'lesser of evils' (in protest of the liberal 'lesser of evils' arguments for Clinton and/or Stein).

Edit: As I realize, La Riva is the perfect protest candidate to make a statement here, as her main activist issues have always been immigrant rights and anti-war.  Trump's main point has been his unabashed anti-immigrant sentiment/racism/xenophobia, and Hillary's known mainly as a war hawk, so...","Political affiliations, Economic systems.",d9054nm,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

Slap on some tax breaks for companies that manufacture here, increase the minimum wage, and make subsidies for companies who need an initial amount of capital to transition towards automation.

For low-skill manufacturing jobs, uou would have to not only make America competitive in low-skill manufacturing in terms of labor laws and regulations, but also prevent automation.

The only solutions I can think of that could achieve both would be to drastically lower the minimum wage or subsidize manufacturing companies heavily. Otherwise, if manufacturing companies are forced to have more business here, they will simply automate and hire educated professionals instead (to manage these systems), contributing to the service industry. 

If you want high paying low-skill manufacturing jobs lowering the minimum wage wouldn't be an option. You would have to pay companies to have a certain number of employees or something to prevent automation. At that point, you might as well nationalize certain industries and have them employ people for manufacturing jobs, but that's an obvious non-starter.

America is slowly completing its transition to a full on service economy where more and more education is required to be competitive in the labor market. Unfortunately I think the people losing their manufacturing jobs are just gonna end up left behind. Retraining isn't very effective because even if successful they'd be starting out in a new industry at the very bottom, when these people simply want their old jobs back.

Personally I think we will eventually reach the point that automation displaces a majority of the current job market, and that it'll happen sooner than people think. While technology does create new jobs, those new jobs don't spring up overnight, and as mentioned previous job-holders can get left behind if it happens too quickly and abruptly. Given the exponential increase in technological advances, I wouldn't be surprised if only highly educated people can easily find well paying jobs, and only those in specialized fields. People shouldn't be too surprised that it's getting harder and harder to find jobs if you have lower skills, and that's never going to change.

I mean the total income for employees, not the total number of people earning an income. Hiring more will happen no matter what as businesses grow.

&gt; Also pretty optimistic to assume if you give everyone money everyone will continue working just as much and will spend more. 

That's why a UBI can't be a living wage. It should be below the poverty line, so people still need to work if they want to stay out of poverty, but people working lower wage jobs will be able to live fairly comfortably. Most people don't want to be in poverty.

Also people will spend more. I don't know your financial situation, nor do I need to know it, but imagine you're making decent money (~40k-50k a year in a low cost of living area). You can pay your bills effectively and save a little bit, but after all of that you only have a little bit of spending money to yourself. If you want to buy something big what do you have to do? You have to spend even less and save up for it, or charge it to a credit card.

But oh look! You suddenly make ~12k per year more, now every month you get an extra 1k tacked on to your pay. Suddenly buying that new dishwasher or computer or whatever is do-able within a month *and* you can even spend more on some other things you want, like home improvements or a trip. You also *know* you're getting that 12k regardless of employment, so if you need to transition jobs or get fired/laid off, you still have something to fall back on just in case until you get another job. 

In any case, UBI doesn't have to be the method of giving people more money. Companies can just pay more too, especially very large ones. Let's take Wal-Mart for example. In 2020 Wal-Mart made ~$15B in profit. Even if they invested half of that back into the business, that's about $7.5B that could be given back to the ~2.3 million employees they have. That's about $3,200 *per employee*.

152,"Thank you for your feedback and for all the upvotes others have given. Want to share my thoughts in regards to some of the points you made.

&gt; VAT definitely targets tech companies as they tend to have very low non-wage expenditures.

If you are aware of any data that supports the idea that VAT is mostly paid for by Big Tech, please share it. My original post is based off of feedback I got from speaking to Democrats who heard Yang’s explanation on UBI in his CNN town hall and in his first debate and who concluded that UBI is not credible after hearing Yang explain it. So, even if you are right, it’s not obvious to most voters, and would require some data to prove it. 

I decided to check the data myself and the data I found does not support your opinion. When you think of Big Tech and job destroying AI, most people think of Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Facebook. The industries represented by those firms include “Internet and Direct Marketing Retail” (Amazon), ‘Systems Software” (Microsoft), and “Interactive Media and Services” (Google and Facebook). I analyzed data for the top 4000 public companies in the US to estimate the total labor related expense for all companies in those 3 industries. It represents a whopping 2.4% of the cumulative labor spend of the top 4000 public companies. These 3 industries represent 3.7% of all non-labor related operating expenses among the top 4000 public companies. This data appears to run counter to your opinion and is more consistent with the intuition of the people I had spoken to. Some notes on my analysis. Employee count and total operating expense are publicly known data points for the top 4000 public companies. The only assumption I had to make was the average salary per employee. I assumed $100k/year per employee for all companies. 

&gt; This description is more inaccurate, IMO. “Double dipping” is not cost savings and shouldn't be lumped in with the other actual cost savings. Andrew's explanation that the cost isn't actually $3 trillion because the FD doesn't stack with current benefits is much more clear.

After re-thinking this, I agree with you that re-basing $3 trillion to a lower number and doing the percentages off of that is probably clearer and better. However, my main point is that the answer should be organized as these are the three drivers for how we pay for it, this is what percentage comes from each of the 3 drivers. He’s the #Math candidate so he should be ordered, and logical, and precise if he wants credibility on this. And, when ordering the key drivers, it’s helpful if value-added tax isn’t the first one he lists, but rather the last one he lists. The reason is that the VAT will be mostly passed on to consumers. And, even if you disagree with me on this, most voters have this assumption so it helps not to lead with the VAT. 

&gt; Even if this is true it's exactly how Republicans justify tax cuts, in which case it's not true. For that reason I prefer that Andrew not focus on it.

It’s quite different. The vast majority of any traditional tax cut benefits the richest citizens since the richest citizens fund the vast majority of the federal budget given that they have the most taxable income. Yang is not doing a tax cut. He’s giving everyone $12k/year, the same amount. The marginal propensity to consume (and therefore drive economic growth) is significantly higher for middle class and low-income individuals than it is for rich individuals who’ll just take the $12k and put it in their mutual fund account. There's a very real difference in results between trickle up versus trickle down stimulus and most people intuitively understand that $1k to a rich person goes in the bank but a $1k to a middle class or low income person gets spent and recirculated in the economy. Yang only briefly alludes to this but he should be spending most of his time explaining this and a lot less time on the VAT.

The first problem with not focusing on the economic growth from UBI is that it leaves the entire explanation for how you pay for it on the VAT. Most people correctly assume that the majority of the VAT will get passed on to consumers. In the last debate, Yang was asked about this and he said that 95% of people will be better off even after accounting for the pass through of the VAT. That seems not credible to the casual listener, the idea that you can tax with one hand and give out with the other and somehow people are better off. The only reason that Yang’s 95% comment is a true statement is because the majority of the FD is actually paid for by economic growth and cost savings. It's wealth creation, not redistribution. But, the casual listener doesn’t understand that because Yang is so focused on the VAT explanation (which sounds like wealth redistribution) and doesn’t prioritize the other 2, arguably more important drivers (which are about wealth creation). The trickle up economic growth and cost savings are the most compelling aspects of his plan

The second problem with simplifying this to a VAT is that Yang is unintentionally belittling the intelligence of the average voter. By stylizing his answers into half-truths, he’s losing credibility since his half-truth explanations don’t make sense when the listener is reasonably educated. Maybe speaking to the lowest level of intelligence works in the Republican primary, but I doubt that works in a Democratic primary where average education levels are higher. 

One last thing I would point out is that Yang’s approval / awareness ratio isn’t something to write home about, so there is definitely an enormous opportunity for improvement in the messaging. Whether it’s my idea or something else.",Taxonomy: Taxes,evdxjfk,"Personally I think Andrew's way of explaining it is much better.

&gt;He currently calls UBI tech money and says he’ll pay for it by getting it from Amazon and other big tech since they don’t pay enough taxes. That’s an overly simplistic explanation and it’s much more false than true.

I disagree. VAT definitely targets tech companies as they tend to have very low non-wage expenditures. My company's incoming VAT is just office rent, office supplies, the occasional computer and some servers. Most of our income is targeted by VAT. Whereas a manufacturer or retailer needs plenty of resources and goods, which will significantly reduce the VAT paid.

&gt;About 45% of it is paid for by cost savings at the federal government level.

This description is more inaccurate, IMO. “Double dipping” is not cost savings and shouldn't be lumped in with the other actual cost savings. Andrew's explanation that the cost isn't actually $3 trillion because the FD doesn't stack with current benefits is much more clear.

&gt;About 30% of it is paid for by economic growth.

Even if this is true it's exactly how Republicans justify tax cuts, in which case it's not true. For that reason I prefer that Andrew not focus on it.

&gt;About 25% of it is paid for with a 10% value added tax which is about the same as a 4-6% sales tax depending on the product or service being sold.

How a company adapts to VAT is mostly dependant on what clients they target. Companies like IKEA or Amazon that target end consumers will keep affordable prices, while companies that target other companies will just pile on the VAT knowing that it'll add to their incoming VAT. I prefer that he doesn't compare it to a sales tax and sticks to the “tax on tech companies” pitch.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Second, concentration of the economy and jobs in a few places is undesirable, and it's a vicious cycle. Fewer jobs means less income, means less spending, means fewer jobs. UBI is an opportunity to break that cycle. If people in smaller towns have income, then they will have money to spend, and their local economies will prosper.

160,"MORSE DOESN’T LOOK like anyone’s idea of a giant-slayer. He’s physically slight and rather pale, with reddish hair and a regular-guy aesthetic. His charisma comes through in the ease with which he lives politics. He’s been doing this work since he was in middle school, and his whole identity has grown up around it.

“The earliest thing I remember about him,” his brother Doug told me, “was I came downstairs one morning, when I had to be about 15 or 16, and he was watching CNN. He was 6 years old on a Saturday morning, where I’d have been watching cartoons, and he was watching CNN.”

At 16, Morse came out as gay and almost immediately founded Holyoke High School’s first Gay-Straight Alliance, which was also one of the city’s first gay rights organizations. In high school he served two terms as student representative for the Holyoke School Committee.

He went to college at Brown University without exactly leaving Holyoke or its politics. The summer before his senior year in college he began assembling a campaign team and raising money for a mayoral run. He announced his candidacy in January of 2011, graduated in May, bested the incumbent mayor by one vote in the September primary, and then beat her again in the run-off by 600 votes.

When he won that first election he was 22, the youngest mayor in the city’s history. He was also its first openly gay mayor and the first mayor who, though himself white, openly and strategically represented the city’s Latino plurality, which has since become a majority of the city’s 40,000 or so people.

“Old Holyoke makes way for New Holyoke,” as the Springfield Republican newspaper put it the day after election night. Nine years on, now in his fourth term as mayor, Morse is still the standard bearer for New Holyoke.

He is also, now, the most visible local champion of a national progressive movement that is hoping to transform the Democratic Party and through it the basic structures of the American government and economy. On issues like renewable energy, affordable housing, and drug treatment and legalization, Morse has taken real political risks in Holyoke, though it’s not yet clear whether they will bear fruit. As a congressman he would advocate for Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, universal basic income, criminal justice reform, and a host of other social democratic policies that, if passed, would make the United States look a lot more like Canada and western Europe.

“When Neal talks, he’s in this realm of what’s possible given the perceived political reality, and so embedded in compromise that nothing is possible,” says Morse. “The conversation starts with [what’s] not possible, rather than what should be possible in a country like ours.”

Morse and I are talking in a conference room in Cubit, a former wire manufacturing plant in downtown Holyoke that has been converted into a very 21st century work/live/study complex. In the basement, where Morse and his team rent space for their campaign, are small offices and co-working spaces. On the first and second floors is the new Holyoke Community College MGM Culinary Arts Institute, a collateral benefit of the recent arrival in Springfield of the MGM Springfield, one of the state’s two sanctioned casinos. On the top two floors are lofts with stunning views of the city’s canals, which once helped power the paper mills and now feed into the power grid.

A few blocks away from Cubit is Gateway City Arts, an arts and office complex that inhabits the husk of an old paper company. In a different direction lies Canna Provisions, a legal marijuana dispensary located in another former industrial space. A bit south is a 45,000-square-foot indoor marijuana farm inside a former paper mill. Morse, who was the first mayor in Massachusetts to come out publicly for legalizing recreational marijuana, has said he would like to see Holyoke become a kind of Amsterdam of the United States, a destination for pot growers, sellers, consumers, tourists, and maybe even cannabis café owners.

This kind-bud version of Holyoke’s future owes its promise to a combination of Morse’s hustle and the organic overflow from nearby, more affluent communities like Easthampton and Northampton. He has worked to bring in the developers and entrepreneurs and has been responsive to the expectations of the gentrifying newcomers. The idea of a truly gentrified Holyoke, however, like a casino-driven renaissance in Springfield, is an attempt to apply a local solution to structural deficits that are national (and in some ways international) in scale.

“Legacy cities,” as the scholars sometimes call the class of small- and mid-sized post-industrial cities into which both Holyoke and Springfield fall, have been rebranding and re-envisioning themselves for decades. The basic macroeconomics, however, haven’t changed. There is money in almost every region. Sometimes it shifts around. But the good jobs for working people, at the scale they’re needed to really change things, haven’t come back. Absent some much larger change, which is impossible without a broad federal response, a Holyoke that got fancy would mean that many of its poor and working-class residents had just moved, or been pushed, elsewhere in the district.

The question for the First District and its representative isn’t how to turn western Massachusetts into a high-skills, high-tech, high-sheen adjunct of its big brother to the east. That may happen, but if the last few decades are any guide it probably won’t. The question is whether there’s an alternative to aping Boston and hoping for the best.",Political affiliations,g003179,"**Article text**: 

Is the world on fire?” I ask Richie Neal.

Richard “Richie” Neal is the longtime US Representative for Massachusetts’ First District, a big swath of the western part of the state that stretches up to Vermont in the north, down to Connecticut in the south, and all the way west to New York. Since 2018, he has also been chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful legislative positions in the country.

We’re talking in January of 2020, in the beforetimes, while I follow Neal on a brief swing through the district. The world doesn’t yet include a global pandemic or massive protests against police violence. It is Donald Trump and opioid addiction, climate change and political polarization, Twitter and declining life expectancies. It’s the craziness of the last few years, before things got even crazier.

The question (is the world on fire?) is less for Neal himself than for the Democratic voters of the First district, who on Sept. 1 will vote in a primary for either the 71-year-old incumbent, a business-friendly moderate, or his liberal challenger Alex Morse, the 31-year-old mayor of Holyoke.

The race is another front in the battle between the party’s left flank and its centrist establishment. It’s also a moment of reckoning for a region that has never recovered from the deindustrialization of the last few decades, one of the left-behind and wounded places in America that Trump’s campaign in 2016 brought to the foreground and promised to heal.

It’s not Trump country yet. It’s safely blue, and will elect a Democrat in November, but it has been trending red over the last few elections, and it poses a challenge that Democrats would be wise to heed, particularly in the face of the pandemic and the economic damage it’s causing. Is there a politics that will enable the small towns and cities of western Massachusetts not just to regroup on the other side of disease and recession, but to be revitalized?

Neal and I are at Holyoke Medical Center, the largest employer in the small city of Holyoke and its main provider of health care services to poor residents. Holyoke is about 10 miles north of Springfield, where I grew up. Both cities suffer from the kinds of poverty, addiction, and hopelessness that we tend to associate with rust belt dystopias like Youngstown, Ohio, and Flint, Mich., with many of the same causes. Of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, Springfield is either the poorest or the second-poorest, depending on how Lawrence is doing in a given year. Holyoke is a close third, and both have proven tragically vulnerable to the opioid epidemic over the past decade. When public health scholars talk about deaths and diseases of despair, these cities and their people are among the afflicted.

These are not abstract issues for either Neal or Morse, both of whom are the children of addiction. Neal’s father died of alcoholism when he was 17. His mother had died a few years before, and he and his sisters, taken in by an aunt, were kept afloat by Social Security benefits. Morse’s mother was haunted by addiction and mental illness her whole adult life. She died of related causes in 2018, when her son was in his third term as mayor. Alex’s older brother Doug, whom I interviewed for this article, died of a heroin overdose in February of this year. (The campaign’s first television ad, released on July 22, is about Doug.)

Neal and I are touring the Holyoke hospital’s recent $25 million expansion, about a quarter of which was financed by federal tax credits that he steered its way. Near the end of the tour we’re shown the new mental health ward, where Morse’s mother was an occasional patient. It’s one of hundreds of places around the region that have benefited from Neal’s influence and attention over the past few decades. Such attention hasn’t changed the overall trajectory of the region, but it has softened the pain. In normal times, this would be more than enough to assure Neal’s re-election. For most of his career it has been. But he is too big a player now, in too fraught a moment, to avoid challenge.

“Are we on fire?” I ask Neal again, and his answer reflects the delicate balance he has to strike as a moderate figure in immoderate times. “The world’s on fire,” he says, “but our institutions are strong.”",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

If the Basic Income is funded voluntarily via charity then there is no problem. But if the system is funded via taxes the only reasons this would end up as a net economic benefit is because producers have underestimated the ability and profit potential of new markets/new employees AND/OR consumers have underestimated the leisure utility provided by their fellow man.

In any other scenario to my knowledge the basic income consumer will become a net drag on the economy because they will never become self sufficient either from a monetary or non-monetary utility standpoint.

Now I'm not saying basic income is a bad idea but one has to realize there is only one scenario in which *all* actors in an economy will be better off. If the condition above does not turn out to be true then the net effect will be to keep some people at some standard of living at a net cost, not a net benefit, to others.

Its actually not new and called ""unconditional basic income"" (UBI). Money itself isn't the problem. Money is just a way to greatly simplify the exchange of goods or services. Without money, you'd have to revert to trading which is impossible for modern societies with their highly specialised work forces. In fact, if you implement UBI, money would be a key prerequisite. 

Now regarding UBI. UBI is an idea that has been around for decades. The core of UBI is that everyone gets the same fixed amount of money with no questions being asked. Everyone. Beggars, workers, millionaires. All other social transfers are eliminated. The UBI should be calculated so that it allows people a humble life. Not more, not less. To allow more luxury a.k.a ""nice things"", one would have to get a job and earn extra money. Taxes would be very high because the base demand to finance UBI would be quite high. Assuming a UBI of $1000 per person, a country like the USA would need $330.000.000.000 each year for UBI alone. Infratructure, education and military would be on top of that. 

You see where this is heading: the cost would be astronomical and so would be the risks. UBI would only work in a perfect society, where there  are no egoistic persons and where productivity would be outstanding. 

Personally I find this a utopia. It sounds nice but it won't work. As a German, I'm pro social security, especially when it comes to universal public health care.

&gt;The difference is one side doesn’t want to support you for problems outside of your control and the other does.

Well that's where the division lies. I firmly believe that most people have control over their own employment prospects. 

We had thousands of people lose their job overnight and instantly line up at Centrelink the next day. These people were likely living beyond their means and just making ends meet for a long time. Part of that is on them. 

Contrary to expected fears, we did not experience a huge surge in homelessness after so many people could no longer pay their rent, because it turns out most young people had the option of staying with their parents. So they weren't seeking welfare for basic shelter and survival, they were seeking welfare so they could have their own place in the heart of CBD. That's a a luxury.

But I do genuinely object to his proposed solutions. When I first heard about UBI, I really liked the idea! I imagined a world where if you had money to live on, and your industry was dying, you could quit, study, and find a new career. That sounds like a great way to navigate our ever-changing world!

But, thinking about it more over the past few years, I don't see it playing out that way. The economy adapts to changes. For example, today we make 10 times as much as we did at some point in the past. But that doesn't mean we can buy 10 times as much stuff, because prices adjust.

So what I actually think will happen is that people will get more money, and the prices of rent, food, etc will go up. And so, essentially, all it will really do is funnel that new income back to the owner class.

One idea to fix that would be to peg basic income to some market rate. If you do that, then the prices will rise and the basic income will rise to keep pace. That's fine. Except now you've ignited inflation. And so everyone who's retired or close to retiring, and has saved up their nest egg? Their saving will quickly become worth less and less.

To be clear, I really do love the spirit of the idea behind it. I just don't think it plays out in reality the way it does in theory. I applaud starting a discussion, but I certainly wouldn't vote to enact this.

I can agree and disagree with this.  You right in that if India and China did industrialised in the same time and manner as the West did it would be significantly bigger. However, don't you think my the time the series is set it would have had the ability to do so. I wager that the economics of that time means that only a smaller highly educated workforce is needed (in the inner worlds). Too many workers means they are superfluous. 

""can fund reasonably comfortable lifestyles for billions of jobless people"". I doubt it. I get the sense that basic assistance there is like living entirely on welfare in the UK. You got a home but it's tight and cramped. You got a basic education, but that won't help you get a job. You free healthcare. Hardly the best lifestyle. Another point is because those on welfare is smaller a tiny percentage it's not so much of a drain as it is on Earth in the series.

""However I must tip my hat at the point being that Earth is spending a lot of its generated wealth on Basic Income citizens. That being said, Mars is also directing a lot of it's wealth into terraforming"". Thank you. I tip my hat to you for making some very good points. But we not given any figures on how much is spend on terra forming vs basic assistance. Mars saying it spends all of its resources on terraforming is like the US saying it's ""tough on defence"". I have no doubt that the US is ""tough on defence"" but its Medicare budget accounts for 19% of the federal budget and defence 18% (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/ce/Fy2010_spending_by_category.jpg). Healthcare is expensive. The UK is probably a better example to compare to Earth. The UK spends about 2% of gdp on defence while spending 9% on health care. 

I wager that (A) Mars spends more on defence but the shortfall comapred to earth os countered by Earth spending on basic assistance. (B) Terraforming is expensive, but not as much as basic assistance is to earth. (C) The way the martian economy is means it is more dynamic than earths.

This was covered in LW if I recall correctly, Mars and the Belt, live off exports from Earth.
Another observation on this comparison, while European economies are substantially smaller than newer economic powers, UK, France and Germany still maintain the most advanced military capabilities (bar the US of course).

2) Well yes I believe population is a significant factor into a countries wealth, you just need the correct social and economic conditions to get that population creating wealth. The problem with China and India is that they are both newly industrialised countries which is why poverty levels there are so high. But both have seen radical market reforms in the past 30 years, they are essentially now capitalist countries who are now the fastest growing economies in the world and are on course to becoming significant rivals to the US and Europe.

&gt; Lol alright I see what you are. We're done here. 

Valid point?

I am keenly aware I'm putting the only female candidate in 4th place, and I really hate doing that. (I don't care if you believe me) 

So far, the social justice planks of most of the candidates have just been each one claiming they support indigenous rights, or workers rights, etc. I deeply care about these rights, but I have no idea how to increase equality. I'm not sure the candidates do either. I want to see concrete social justice ideas, but other than claims about which candidate cares the most, I just haven't seen real planks in their platform. 

If I ask a POC, LGBTQ2+ or indigenous person what they need, I don't often hear unified specific demands with which the government can act.

Without those, it's hard for candidates to make specific planks for social justice. What happens then is that social justice can't be part of how I make a decision on which candidate I support. 

All the candidates seem to shout is, ""We need to stop just giving lip service to equality. We need a government who will provide action! And I am the person who will do just that!"" 

That's just not enough. 

As for UBI, UBI has been proposed by right and left wing economists. 

Even if it is solely from the right, the left wing does not have a monopoly on good ideas. We need to take the best ideas from wherever they come from, and debate them based on their own merit. 

Taxing the rich and ending corporate subsidies is a good idea, I'd like to see how they plan on doing it.

One way to both nationalize companies and end corporate subsidies would be to pass legislation banning them, unless the tax payers received an equal amount of stock, of said company.

Note: I am a non-religious, straight white employed disabled male from a abusive religious homeschooled family. I don't feel like I can weigh in properly on how to fix the issues of minorities I'm not a part of. But I can listen, and support the ideas they have.

Well, partial UBI is not what I'm talking about. Yes you would have to reconsider a whole bunch of things in that case. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by 'partial', anyway.

If UBI is the only entitlement then it needs to be adequate for the very poor, so the whole population has to get paid for the lowest common denominator. That's my point.

&gt;No, you would just change the place of the trap then.

How so? 

Suppose everyone above the cutoff for UBI gets an income tax cut. Of course you can smooth it out so there is no sharp threshold.

&gt;The economy doesn't account for the needs of people, only for the needs of money. 

Well technically yes, but you could say the same thing about the economic *benefits* of UBI as well.

When distortions hurt the economy they are also hurting workers by raising unemployment, hurting consumers by raising prices, hurting retirees by reducing investment returns. These are real costs. Yes an efficient market does not directly maximize utility, but making it inefficient just makes things even worse unless you do it very carefully and deliberately.

Of course, there are some kinds of taxes that maybe are just fine. Maybe we can raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, or take a little money off of every financial transaction. Great ideas! Except when you have a proposal like this, you're going to want to do it *even if you don't have UBI*. Even with the existing welfare state we're already going to want to implement common-sense tax increases, and use those to reduce the budget deficit at the very least. So it's a little disingenuous to say that we can pay for a new program with such appealing taxes; the *true* cost will be the least-appealing taxes that we will be forced to implement in the budget.

To give an example, I could say ""I'll pay for UBI with income taxes on the upper class,"" and also say ""I'll pay for Medicare-For-All with a VAT."" It sounds like UBI is being paid for with an appealing income tax, but in reality if I abandoned UBI I could keep those income taxes and use them to pay for M4A, dropping the VAT. So in reality it's the VAT that's paying for UBI, even though I don't say it that way.

(FWIW, Yang wants to use a VAT for UBI anyway.)","- Taxes
- Budget and finance",emo0dlq,"&gt; Keynesian assumptions are generally very controversial among economists.

Excuse me? The exact magnitude is obviously never easy to predict, but the basic mechanism is sound. Keynesianism is a major idea in economics and if you can dismiss that, then you can dismiss all the others too.

&gt;But generally speaking, the flat nature of UBI means that it cannot properly support people without being a very expensive program.

Even a partial UBI would vastly improve the security of people with precarious employment.

&gt;If you want to have welfare without having a poverty trap, it might be better to simply reduce non-needy people’s income taxes rather than paying them a monthly sum, as there would be fewer taxes distorting the economy.

No, you would just change the place of the trap then.

Either way, if the economy dictates that 90% of the income should go to 10% of the people then I'll gladly distort that. The economy doesn't account for the needs of people, only for the needs of money. You can only claim that the market reflects the needs of the population if everyone had the same income and everyone had to spend their money prioritizing what they wanted. *Then* you'd get undistorted inputs on the demand side.

&gt;In addition to the basic economic issues, there is a political problem with UBI. The moralism and lifestyle changes associated with UBI and its universal nature make it unusually risky for becoming an entrenched entitlement program with no prospect for reform or replacement.

In the absence of a real solution, it’s an easy fallacy to slip into where someone reaching towards a solution from another angle seems like they aren’t reaching far enough. They may even be reaching farther than you are, but by definition of *the absence of a real solution*, both of you at your best could not come to a solution. 

There’s a third factor we’re overlooking here, and that’s population, or demand. It’s easy to talk about how the Boomers were able to do so much with less. It’s also easy to forget how far *fewer* of them there were than later generations. The sheer demand created by the population growth means there’s less to go around.

266,"Thanks for this, very interesting.
OK, so here is my way of limiting the ""check boxes"": 
Capital or the use of technology would never be a factor because the right to UBI stems from the following: should a human being be teleported to the exact same identical planet with no technology available, he/she would have access to a certain amount of resources/goods freely available and provided by nature which he/she would have to pick up using his own two hands. So imagining a futuristic scenario where all the arable land on planet earth is covered with concrete, humans are so numerous that there isn’t an inch of wild nature, all of the necessary food is provided by vertical farms cultivated by robots, all humans would receive UBI which grants them access to basic necessities of life based on the fact that even if none of it had existed, if all of those things disappeared and earth was restored to its original natural state, they would have access to a basic amount of freely available food (goods/resources).

Again, I don't understand your ""if everyone agrees with me, then everyone agrees with me"". It's rather ""if everyone agrees with me, then here are the full implications of what that belief entails"". In your previous post, you underlined that property rights depend on external validation, especially via institutions. What you are implying is: ""everyone is forced to agree with me, via enforcement of institutions which have the monopoly over the use of force and over the rule of law, and hopefully, a majority of opponents to the initial forced upon agreement will never materialize""... I don't see how this is better, or makes the discussion/debate advance?

To your last comment, I would be very interested to know why you don't think the ""mixing labour"" rationale would not be appealing. 

Thanks again for the exchange, I will integrate your remarks in the essay.",None of the above.,dmyy2he,"&gt; do you imply that the most efficient method for carrying out the labour should be a variable added to the measurement of the legitimate claim to property?

I think that having a rigorous series of checkboxes that are compared against other claims is going to always leave out some variable that is unknown at the time, that should be included. Soon enough, the checklist will be so long as if we never created one. So, not really, because I think that 'proving' who has the right to certain property is going to be a self-defeating, graspless task.

&gt;In my article, I clearly point out that all this reasoning is based on the assumption that all of the people identified in the thought experiment agree to the premise that property rights are derived from mixing one's labour with resources/goods available in nature

So your argument is just saying ""if everyone agrees with me, then everyone agrees with me"", not advancing anything? Like, yes, if one thinks that the only part of property is time and energy (which, by the way, is not scientifically proven anywhere in your essay or in your response), then of course they would probably agree with the conclusion.

This is their tax rate without a UBI. Yang proposes a 10% value added tax on every transaction (google ad click, amazon sale, robot truck mile) excluding consumer staple goods. While we would technically have a tax hike of 10% on consumer goods, the only way the tax would result in a net loss from UBI is if you spent a staggering $120,000 a year on consumer goods.

I also work very hard for not enough pay and that's part of the problem for everyone, that there is quite enough money to go around, but it's not being distributed like it should be to ensure a society that doesn't live on the knife's edge. 

I'm not much of an advocate for a UBI because I think it would become another reason to blame the poor for being poor when they use the extra money to get by slightly easier without having treated the underlying issue that led to their problem in the first place, which is systemic. 

I think you're underestimating the amount of wealth accumulation at the very top of the society. When over 80% of the wealth gains have gone to the top 1% over the last few years (article on the front page yesterday I believe) there is absolutely enough capital to be spread around. 

The truth is that there hasn't been anywhere near enough growth in wages over the last 40 years due in large part to the shrinking of unions and continued corporate consolidation of power in both the private and public spheres. 

When pseudo-oligarchs like the Mercers, Kochs, or Adelson can blow 23 million dollars on state wide elections without having to bat an eye (source us Jayne Mayer's book ""Dark Money"", but you could read any book about campaign finance and you'll hear all about it), they create an incongruency between the supposed points of emphasis for elected leaders (the constituency) with regulatory power and who they actually have to cozy up to to maintain their positions (the donation class). This creates a standard that says, ""cut my taxes or I will destroy you"". We've all read the reports about how a number of high level donors used their clout this way in regards to the recent tax bill. 

I bring this up because it is fundamental to the problem that a majority of Americans find themselves in. There isn't enough tax base or political will to provide legitimate programs to help the poor achieve a decent educational and public health outcomes. May it be the disparate graduation rates and post-K-12 admission of poor people and the rich, or something like the still unresolved Flint water crisis. 

I lived through it and I'm the only one who came out better than I started, the rest of my friends received a poor education with no planning or help beyond that ""a mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell"". 

We need job training programs, we need infrastructure development paid for by the state (worked in the 30s), we need better schools with better paid teachers and we need better minimum wages that won't leave people without benefits if they actually get a job. In the status quo a person is often kicked off of state assistance if they get a job so instead of striving for something better they often sit by because at least this way they have health care and food on the table. 

If we want to change these outcomes we will have to pay a bit more of a price, and that means the people who have benefited the most are in a position where they are going to have to foot more of the bill. This is because we're all connected in this society. Businesses don't exist without infrastructure, and bankers don't become rich without usury. The problem is that the individuals are reaping the benefits of the system without giving back to the system what allowed them to flourish in the first place. 

So, should we give all the poor people money? Maybe, but what we need to do is create a more fair tax base that utilizes that money in a way that helps alleviate poverty instead of treating that substantial part of society as a burden they wish would just disappear. This is because they won't disappear and their suffering does negatively impact you through wide spread defaulting on loans and multigenerational reliance on public assistance without a legitimate way to see a way out.

Now we're stuck. Trump's only ideas were to implement more supply-side economics and raise tariffs. The latter is a terrible idea because we're already intimately tied to the global economy, so that's really a tax back to US citizens.

Some people are just not intellectuals, and are a poor fit for those jobs.

We still need to offer retraining, because that’s still over a third of workers that can get folded into the new economy, and UBI with some college tuition &amp; loan reform could go a long way there. For the rest, there’s the hope of new unskilled jobs that might develop over time, or that already exist, but they may have to relocate for.

The Bernie/Warren camp would say we should answer that with a Federal Jobs Guarantee. I think that would help some, but I’m not sure it’s necessary, or even a good idea. A lot of these people are getting new jobs, they just pay less than the old ones. What they want are their old jobs back, or a job that pays similarly. UBI increases disposable income directly, and can make up some of that difference.

The people are then free to use that additional income to live, work, and learn however they feel is in their best interests. I think that’s a better approach than putting them on a tree-planting crew, and telling them it’s that or starve. Poor and non-college workers are adults, and can make their own determination on what’s valuable to do with their time.

316,"This is quite accurate.

The Democratic Party's entire strategy with Biden right now is:

1)  Hide Biden, because eveyrone hates Biden more and more, the more they see of him.  Covid helps them create vague excuses for Biden's groundhog day"" style sequestration, where he only occasionally pokes his head out to utter some nonsense and prove he's still technically 'alive.'

and

2)  Hope upon hope that Covid continues unabated, and shows up 'Le Orange Man.""  Covid also helps them, because Biden is such a shit show that he would certainly be far behind Trump, had China not brought the world to its knees.  Remember that Trump's approval ratings were higher than ever right before Covid, and that unemployment was very low as Covid suddenly intervened.

Democrats I've talked to have struggle to suppress a happy little smirk as they discuss Covid numbers going up.

It is very strange to see them rooting against the United States, and rooting for people's deaths ... rather than trying to fix the problem.

Howie misses a major additional point, however:  

There would be no meaningful ""re-open"" movement - none at **ALL** \- if Pelosi had introduced emergency UBI and/or a German-style short term employment guarantee plan, as temporary measures during a time of crisis.  People who want to ""re-open"" are often scowled at by my friends who are Dem loyalists.  They sneer and look down their noses at ""the poors.""  I mean ... 

""How **DARE** they want to go back to work?  How **DARE** they want to keep their jobs, and pay for their homes and their bills?  How **DARE** they fear for their futures?  They should just **BE LIKE US**, and have financial stability!  Stop being so poor, you fucking 'poors'!  You worthless lazy pieces of shit!  You should've gotten the degree I got.  Stop complaining now.  I don't care if you may be literally starving.  You stay home and 'take it' you fucker!  I have a nice work-from-home job, and I guess you should have planned ahead better.""

Mind you, NOBODY **WANTS** to go ""back-to-work.""  Not one motherfucker I met **WANTS to go back to work.**  Not one motherfucker I ever met **WANTS** to work **AT ALL.**  We work to survive. If the government stepped in with meaningful UBI, and told your employer they'd be compensated for your lost labor, but only if they keep you on payroll and keep you home ... if we had a functioning Democratic Party, instead of two Republican Parties ... Would people be eager to go back to work?  To rush back to their bullshit jobs, and their shitty bosses, and their fuckhead customers?  Hell the fuck no!

But the Democrats just mock these people, these people who would work shitty jobs for shitty bosses, with shitty customers, just to make shitty wages and have shitty health insurance for their families.  These people aren't ""eager to go back to work"" and they aren't being stupid.  They're trying to survive.  They hated their jobs already, and now they have to expose themselves to Covid just to make shit wages?  There was a great cartoon on YouTube that showed people mocking a desperate person who wanted to go back to work, who was suffering from food insecurity and about to lose their home.  The smug types just kept mocking ""You're murdering grandma because you just want a haricut!"" - I've seen so much of this in real life.

They will reluctantly go back to their jobs, because Pelosi will not introduce and promote meaningful help for them.  She only helps her billionaire buddies, and smirks as we are brought to our knees and then she says ""Trump did this!  Vote (D) in November!""

They'll go back to work if they can, and they'll fight for the ability to slave away while exposing themselves to risk.  Yes they will do it, but only because Pelosi was so busy giving money to rich people like her husband, that she 'forgot' to do ONE DAMN THING for ordinary people.  Now they are desperate.  Ronald Reagan taught Pelosi to do this.

She didn't 'forget' to help.  She remembered to act as a politician.  She remembered her **HERO** Ronald Reagan!  She remembered that if the country is screwed, people will vote out the current President, and likewise if it's the other way around.  She remembered Reagan's ""[Are You Better Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loBe0WXtts8)?"" speech.  She devised a strategy based on that speech's main point:  If the nation suffers, they will vote for change.  Even if you hold up a right-wing NeoLib/NeoCon with dementia, they'll vote for him if you make the situation desperate enough.  

So when the nation is desperate, they their backs on them all, on the whole nation.  “Turn up the heat, and we’ll get the votes.”

The Democrats are smirking as the country falls apart, and they have the keys to the solutions in their very hands.  But they feign helplessness as they watch the nation burn ... because that's how they believe they'll get people to vote Biden.  Biden can only win if Trump is in crisis.

The House or Representatives and its Speaker (Nancy Pelosi) DELIBERATELY gave trillions to wealthy corporations and individuals (like her husband), and gave us:  NO healthcare, NO UBI to stay at home and avoid spreading the disease and dying, NO job guarantee program, NO meaningful help whatsoever.

It's been 7 months now, and they still refuse to help.  They just stand there, doing **not a fucking** thing, but shouting at Le Orange Man.  They refuse to help, which is their literal **DUTY** to the United States, and they just watch the whole thing burn down so that they can ridicule the village idiot for political points, instead.

They smirk as the country falls apart ""See?  That's what you get if you vote Trump and don't support Biden!  Take your punishment, you little fucking 'citizens'!  We are oh-so-smart!""

Th open hatred towards those less fortunate.  The desire to see the poor die for their political needs.  The accusation that people who are in dire financial straits 'deserve to suffer.'

There will be fewer people working, sure, but demand for services will be more concentrated on the upper class (which are truly benefiting).

If you're subsisting entirely off of basic income, obviously you're not paying that back in taxes. If you make a fortune, you'll pay more. If you're not actually a human being, because you're a fictional legal entity, you're presumably not eligible for basic income but are still paying taxes. The mechanisms for this are already in place from your run of the mill progressive tax brackets.

For the average person - someone paying the average amount of taxes, it's a wash. (Note that the average Canadian pays less than the average amount in taxes, because median is not the same as mode.)

The interesting bits are what you get out of it:

- No more welfare fraud. Welfare fraud is a hugely overstated issue, but basic income eliminates it entirely, because there's no more welfare. Everyone gets the same basic income, so there's nothing to cheat on. It adds a bit more incentive to cheat on your taxes, but governments are already good at dealing with that and mechanisms are already in place to do so.

- Eliminates the perverse incentive to *not work.* When your benefits are tied to whether you're working or not, and minimum wage is so low that you will earn less than welfare in a normal work week, there's a strong incentive to not start working since it'll be a step back. With basic income, any money you make from any source improves your income rather than harming it, since you get basic income either way.

- More small business creation. While you're employed, you pay unemployment insurance. You only get that money back if you're fired, not if you leave your job to create your own business. Basic income lowers the barriers to creating your own small business, which if successful will pay more taxes to your national government than the probably internationally owned corporation you used to work for would have.

- Fairer labour market. You can start looking at doing things like eliminating the minimum wage, because that minimum income is already provided by basic income. However, this wouldn't be the disaster that it would be currently, since people aren't forced to work: employers would have to pay people the amount that it takes to make it worth their while to do the job instead of being the only alternative to starvation.

- Allows for socially useful but not necessarily financial optimal work. There are a lot of volunteers out there who do good work for no money. If their basic needs were taken care of, they'd be able to do more of it. We'd see a lot more fulltime artists and other producers of culture. While it will vary how much you might value things like this as an individual, the fact is you spent $160 on your cable bill last month and all of it was shit.

- Straightforward humanitarian reasons. People not starving to death on the streets, that sort of thing.

The problem is that this scheme doesn't seem like it would work very well on the provincial level. Canada guarantees mobility for its citizens - a province which does this basically is going to be attracting the lazy and jobless and running out everyone else with increased tax burden. You sort of need immigration controls to make this sort of thing work, which means that it'd be safer to do as a federal program since the national level is the level at which we control migration.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Labor Day is especially ironic for this reason.  For a lot of Americans, the ""holidays"" are worse than normal, not better.

Also, most of the currently recognized or proposed Federal holidays float a few days so that they can always fall on a weekday, typically a Monday.  They can't fall on a Saturday or Sunday, because everyone already has that day off.  Everyone who matters, anyway.

Several of the officially recognized holidays are already controversial; There's long been an initiative to repurpose Columbus Day as Indigenous People's Day, and that's more likely to happen now that we're actually pulling down the bastard's statues.  President's Day, as I said elsewhere, is pretty much an excuse for irritating car (and mattress, thank you) commercials.  Then there's Martin Luther King Jr. Day, increasingly transforming into the ""National Day of Service.""

I've also got a bug up my ass that Christmas is a federal holiday.  It took some serious mental gymnasics by the courts to declare Christmas ""secularized"" and therefore not a breech of the establishment clause of the 1st amendment.  But, what the fuck, we're a Christian extremist dictatorship anyway, it's not to be helped.

So, hopefully I've demonstrated that blanket federal holidays as we know them are designed for a society that doesn't exist--a homogeneous people who all work Monday-Friday, 9-5 and all have the same reasons to celebrate on the same days, and a poor fit for the society that does exist--a near complete cross-section of humanity with a wide variety of cultures, religions and personal histories, many of whom have jobs that society cannot tolerate going entirely undone for a whole day.

Instead, I would propose a more individualized approach.  Currently, some employees (again, usually those better off higher up the ladder) are given paid vacation and sick days as part of their compensation.  I propose mandating no fewer than ten, perferably twenty personal paid holidays to ALL citizens (possibly as a form of universal basic income, paid by the government rather than the employer) to allow each individual to choose when/how they want to rest, celebrate, worship or mourn.  This would better support America's many diverse religious, cultural and historical heritages.  The devout could choose to take off their particular religious holidays, the patriotic could take off historical dates, those who lost loved ones could take days of mourning such as December 7th or September 11th, activists could take off MLK day, International Women's Day, Arbor Day etc.  Or, anyone could take off personal time that means something to them, the birthday of a loved one, your wedding anniversary, ComicCon, who cares.  More citizens actually get holidays that mean something to them in their lives, and society as a whole keeps running as normal, none of those spikes in demand for food service, retail, hospitality, and emergency services that accompany mass-vacationers.",Labor wages and work conditions.,fvcwb77,When your racism is stronger than your desire for a day off from work in the summer to BBQ.,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

354,"#Our core goal is to uplift everyone to at least the average of society. 

That's.... honestly, that's the heart of it. Most of us, the vast majority, don't want to run around penalizing everyone. What the hell for?

Right now, with enough information, down to the zip code, you can 100% quantify what an exactly middle-class existence, dead center, would look like. How much income, size/type of home, crime rates, arrest rates, education levels/spending, family data, spending power, wealth, various other factors. You can absolutely quantify this. 

By definition, 50% of America is not there, and sometimes not by a *lot*. 

What I want to see in my life is that that 50% midpoint, in the USA, is the *floor*. The absolute bottom *floor*. If you want to go legitimately earn $1B by building and selling widgets that people want... please proceed. You'll be taxed accordingly. You can still have your nice gated 10,000+ square foot house. I don't care; your living on top of basically a manicured reservation for rich people doesn't impact my existence day to day. 

But no one should *want* for the basics. Food. Shelter. Health. Existence. 

Take all that data, and you can measure it, exactly, to figure out down to the zip code the most ""middle"" zip code in the *entire* USA. It could be in Kansas, or NYC, or LA, or some random town in Colorado. I have no idea. But, comparing them all by math, you *can* find this!

Whatever that relative value is, that's the first goal. 

People can be exceptional. Go, kick ass. *Drag us* into progress, of various sorts! Be the Wright brothers or Bezos or Turing or whatever, no one cares. We *want* that. We *celebrate* innovation and growth of the species. Bezos is a putz, but a lot of the stuff Amazon has done for technology is gonna benefit us in a lot of ways over the years. That's a fact. Concentrate that many big brains together and the results become multiplicative. Besides, Amazon is notorious for collecting alpha driven science/tech geniuses, dumping crazy money on them, and working them to the bone for several years before they leave. All those people are getting together, forging friendships, and side ideas, that will benefit us all. Random math genius, pre-Amazon? Maybe he ends up teaching at some local college in Iowa. Instead, he's drafted by Amazon and he's now in a room of his peers, instead of trying to teach more average kids. 

He got that opportunity -- and now because he's with the rest, he can drive us further, faster, harder into the future. Maybe not at Amazon, but do you know how many spin-off companies and ideas that have benefited us spun out of places where bright people congregate, like Microsoft, Facebook, and others? They're in many ways intellectual boiler rooms. That's huge. 

THAT is the THE good thing about capitalism. One of the few. We *love* that part.

So, remember how I opened? 

We want everyone--through education, and uplifting everyone--to be able to get to that point if they choose.  A conservative will say, ""nothing's stopping anyone! BOOTSTRAPS!!"" A liberal will say, ""Where does the kid with the brain meats to support a genius level intellect ever going to achieve that living in a shitty run down house with no toilet service in rural Appalaccia, with garbage schools, meth everywhere, no jobs, and no prospects? I grew up in a substandard environment, putting it mildly, but nothing that bad. We're not saying everyone would get a 90210 or Greenwich level education (in our lifetimes), but me, as a kid, and that kid in the mountains? 

Whatever midpoint baseline is, you're damn right that should be the MINIMUM. Nationally. 

Now do the same for all the rest: income, size/type of home, crime rates, arrest rates, education levels/spending, family data, spending power, wealth, various other factors.

tl;dr #1: any societal thing can be ran by math into a bell curve. Anything. The long term goal of nearly every liberal is to make it so that at least the left 45% or so of the bell curve is *erased*, and everyone can at least be at that new baseline minimum floor. Run your imagination on how positive, beneficial, and wonderful this would be for our American society over the next few generations. The multiplicative effects -- there's that word again -- would start to compound like positive interest, and next thing you know, by 2100 everyone or nearly all could be on the right side of that bell curve.

Side perk for the hard ""society"" conservatives so worried about crime: you know 95%+ of crime is driven by poverty in some manner, and the rest is stupidity, ideology, and other things like drink/drugs? Put a society-level bullet in the head of poverty and you eliminate *most crime*. If an Amazon box thief steals stuff to resell because otherwise he won't make rent because he's unskilled, no good jobs, or other things, and you get everyone a good education, a good job, UBI, whatever you want to call it, and so that the Amazon box thief doesn't need to steal to make rent... why would he steal?

tl;dr #2: once the USA achieves that prosperity, it would logically begin to spillover to the rest of the world. Pick the poorest country on Earth. I don't know what that is. Sudan? Bangladesh? I'm honestly not sure. Our fondest longterm dream would be for that middle of the bell curve floor to be the minimum floor for the *entire species*.

It must be high enough to provide a basic standard of living and to allow reasonable consumer spending.

Yeah, if those people are landlords. The concern is not necessarily inherent to UBI (though there are plenty of leftist critiques of it), it's that Yang's plan is abysmal. It would functionally end up looking like a wealth transfer to the land/capital owning class as rents prices would respond rapidly. It's also paid for with a VAT tax, which disproportionately hits working class people by artificially raising prices across the board. Lastly, Yang is on record as saying he wants to strip existing social programs in favor of his UBI plan.

I'm glad this subreddit and people like you exist to add a voice of reason and sanity into this insane world.

The big myth about economic growth is the idea that it doesn't matter how much the richest earn as long as the pie grows so that the slices of the pie, however small for everyone else, are still getting bigger too.

Recent data from both the [OECD](http://www.oecd.org/newsroom/inequality-hurts-economic-growth.htm) and [IMF](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/06/15/growths-secret-weapon-the-poor-and-the-middle-class/) show that not only is this false, bit it's entirely backwards.

http://imgur.com/cUFsoDl

According to the IMF, increasing the share of the total pie of the top 20% by just 1%, however large the pie is, *decreases* economic growth by 0.08 points. On the other hand, increasing the share of the bottom 20% by 1%, increases economic growth by 0.38 points. Similar growth increases are seen in decreasing amounts for the middle quintiles as well.

http://imgur.com/D92yu7r

So this idea that we should let inequality increase because it grows the total pie is complete and utter bullshit. By letting inequality increase, the pie actually shrinks. If we want the pie to grow we need to shift some of that clotted wealth in the hands of the top 20% over to the other quintiles, and the more we shift towards the bottom, the larger the entire pie will grow.

In other words, we need to be doing the reverse so that everyone is better off, including the rich. By taxing the rich more heavily, so as to transfer that income to the bottom and middle, the slightly smaller slice owned by the rich will be a bigger slice. Someone earning $2 million per year will be left with $1.2 million after taxes instead of $1.4 million, but because GDP will grow their investments will grow as well. Instead of earning $2 million before taxes, they'll earn more, and so be better off even with higher taxes.

This is a huge reason to support the idea of /r/basicincome - increased economic growth that benefits **everyone**.

Right now we have a GDP growth rate of around 3%. With a basic income functioning as a means of reducing the share of the top 20%, and increasing the shares of the bottom 80% by giving everyone $1,000/mo, we should expect to see a new GDP growth rate of around 5-6%. We haven't seen anywhere near this kind of growth since the 1980s, but we can see it again, if we start crafting policies that make sense using what we know, instead of continuing to rely on myths and gut instinct morality-driven bullshit policies that only serve to benefit an extremely small portion of our society.

Technology is currently being misused, in that it's only benefiting the top 1%. GDP is being pulled down by growing inequality and [productivity is being pulled down by people working more hours instead of fewer hours](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/our-paradoxical-economy-c_b_7750222.html).

Deloc oportun, având în vedere că deja avem ajutorul social care în zonele rurale împing oamenii să să lucreze în paralel la negru cu ziua, sau să facă copii pe bandă rulantă pt mai mulți bani pe lună. Mi se pare că în România UBI acum e foarte vulnerabil să fie corupt ca mecanism de păstrare a oamenilor deja saraci in sărăcie perpetua pt a-i avea ca prizonieri care să voteze cum vrea un partid de genul PSD-ului.

Pe lângă asta, cred că fondurile ar putea fi folosite mai bine. De exemplu, să îmbunătățești sistemul de educație în așa fel încât oamenii care își pierd jobul din cauza automatizării să se poată reprofila ușor și rapid. Ideea e să concentrăm eforturile acolo unde e nevoie, nu să le împrăștiem la nivelul întregii populații. 200 eur ar avea un impact mult mai mare dacă îl investești în educația unui om sărac decât dacă ii dai unui ITist cu venit de 1500 eur/lună.

&gt;ce valoare credeti ca ar trebui sa aiba?

Cum am zis mai sus, depinde de câți oameni primesc astfel de bani. Dacă e vorba toți cei 14 milioane de români din țară, 100eur/lună înseamnă 17 miliarde €/an. E o sumă pe care nu cred că bugetul României și-o permite. Dacă vrei într-adevăr Universal, 10€/luna e ceva mai realist. Dar nu are niciun impact. Din cauza asta spun că mai bine ne focusam pe cei 10% din populație cu cel mai mare risc de sărăcie. Cel puțin pana ajungem și noi cu PIB/locuitor de 30000-40000€.

&gt;Ce conditii ar trebui sa indeplineasca o persoana ca sa aiba access la UBI?

Dacă pui condiții de selecție, deja nu mai e universal. Dar trecem peste. As pune condiții legate de cum se cheltuie acei bani. Dacă nu facem asta, atunci e riscul să cauzam haos economic din cauza creșterii bruște a consumului. Imaginează-ți că toată lumea cheltuie acei bani pe ciocolată.

399,"This criticism is purely conjecture, the correct response is to collect actual data instead of speculating. Anyway let me offer an equally speculative counter point. 

First the premise of this is that people's sole motivation for work is salary, we know work is important for many other reasons including giving people purpose, belonging to a group, status in society. 

Secondly we know that with this rise of automation there will be less and less work to do. A necessary part of that will be increased non-work time. UBI defines whether that is ""leisure"" time or crime and pan handling to survive. 

Thirdly UBI will massively stimulate the economy, the  increased spending power of the middle class will drive the economy allowing much better wages so even a basic job could potentially afford someone luxury items. 

Fourthly what you suggest would be leisure time might take a very different form. Current unemployment rate of 5% means many people are isolated and restricted to ""leisure"" activities. If there are more people with more free time there is the potential for social interactions and groups. Also with more wealth around this extra time can be devoted to endeavors less focused on the bottom line like science and the arts. ","- Labor wages and work conditions
- Automation and jobs",d9mtnv8,"So I post the following in every ""Basic Income"" thread I come across, and I've yet to receive a satisfying answer:

A common criticism of UBI is that if too many people simply took the income and resorted to leisure, then there wouldn't be a tax base large enough to sustain the program and it would collapse.

UBI proponents usually respond to this by asserting that the income provided under a UBI program would be just enough to get by - you'd survive, but not have any money for luxuries. Everybody wants at least some luxuries, the theory goes, so enough people will work to fund the system.

However, and here is my question: How does this account for economies of scale?

Let's imagine that the UBI is set to $15,000. Just barely enough to keep a roof over your head and a meal in your stomach. Now, let's imagine a family unit with Mom, Dad, their 20 year old son, 19 year old daughter, Grandma, Grandpa, and Aunt Suzie the spinster. 7 people total. 

Together, they bring in $105,000/year in UBI.

Granted, that income isn't going to be buying any BMWs when it has to provide for 7 people, but given economies of scale this family would easily be able to afford significant luxuries - especially in cheaper areas of the country (which they could move to, since they don't need to be close to any jobs).

The ability to scale income like that completely defeats the idea of only allowing a subsistence level of income on UBI, and therefore threatens to send the entire system into the death spiral and collapsing as mentioned above.

So I'm curious - how do proponents of UBI respond to this?

Equality of Opportunity leaves you pretty open to a Living Wage or UBI CP. Wages are a more surefire way of getting to where you want to be, while housing may not include everybody.

For defining guarantee, it'll most likely just boil down to guaranteeing access to be housed, or guaranteeing the ability to be housed. Access would be more broad. That might flow to the neg who could say that it it's ""technically"" possible for everyone to have access to a house in the squo because everyone is allowed to buy a house.

407,"It would never find traction in the United States for a variety of reasons.

Most notably, the fact that it would effectively default the inflation back to $0 anyway. Meaning whatever you set, would effectively be worthless after free market supply and demand got done resetting price valuation.

But it's worse than that in reality.

Minimum wage for work is already a hot button topic in America. But at least with a minimum wage the working force of the US effectively pays for the minimum wage worker. 

IE: Those with disposable income (so well over minimum wage poverty levels) are the ones providing the profits to companies that hire unskilled labor. And obviously I mean as a larger percentage of a whole. Don't think I'm suggesting that minimum wage workers aren't shopping at Walmart or eating at McDonalds, they are, just not with the greater money transfer to those companies as someone making $75k. But medical benefits, disability, et al, are largely being subsidized by those tax payers who are making more than minimum wage.

However! Even in that entire scenario, the minimum wage worker is still providing a societal benefit. So the discussion rumbles on, but most people want everyone to have a livable wage regardless of job.

Like, I said, with grumblings, but there it is.

Now, you asked about a universal basic income. IE: I wake up in the morning, eat Cheetos, and watching reruns all day, and at the end of the year, I get my government check for lets say $15,000. There isn't a scenario you could paint in which that would be acceptable to the American people. It would find absolutely no support in a congress that has tax paying constituents to listen to.

And I would be curious if that money went to everyone over say the age of 18. Regardless of income. Does the guy making $75k *also* get his $15k? Does it raise his taxes? If so, inflation resets everything universal income back to $0. And the 15k is meaningless.

Currently there are approximately 243,000,000 Americans over age 18. At $15k/each, the government would need to come up with $3,645,000,000,000 ($3.6 TRILLION) just to cover that.
Which would be 18% of the GDP (@$20T) 

Mind you, the ""out of control military budget"" of the US is only approximately 4% of the GDP.

So that won't work, since the number would increase every single year.

But even if you said ""only people who can't work, are disabled, are single parents who can't raise kids and work at the same time, etc, etc"", the problem still grows out of control too quickly.

Right now with minimum wage, the free market and corporations are picking up that tab. The instant you say ""universal basic income"", that's the government picking up the tab. Which would ultimately come from tax payers. If we look at labor participation rates in the US we see as of May 2014 it's 62.8% (http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000), which, can I just say, holy shit that's pathetic.

It's at like a 35 year low or something.

So that means currently, 37.2% of Americans are not in the labor force. Now, yes, you have to account for retirees, which I am not going to remove, cuz it's late, and I'm tired of doing percentage math. :)

But, lets leave them in for a ""worse case scenario"". That means at $15000 basic universal income 117.5 million Americans are not working (for a variety of reasons). 
Which of course works out to $1,762,500,000,000 ($1.76 trillion), which, again, is unrealistic.

The ACA (Affordable Care Act or ""Obamacare"") had the US Government try and pay for 40 million uninsured people.... imagine the fight trying to cover 117 million with a basic universal income would spark. ;)

You don't need to hire (many) people to investigate if someone is really in need or if they're gaming the system.  It's worth noting that most UBI schemes would replace other entitlement spending, or, in Andrew Yang's case, phase out those systems.

so the process of dictating how much i have to pay when and who plus how it will be gathered and then distributed will be easy and no bureaucratic red tape trough out this governmental structure. Have you seen our government? its made to be slow for a reason from the very beginning. 

&gt;  Would you extend the same logic to, say, building roads or prisons as you would to social welfare? That people should either do it for profit or off their own back out of compassion? 

In my opinion for me the government should have a very small role in our lives. It should make sure we as a society are following the laws (contracts) that we have made, defend and protect its citizens, and to maintain basic infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and public and governmental buildings so the whole country can stay connected via trade routes and we have a common place to receive information of our laws and regulations. 

Now social welfare i have a constant debate over it personally. For example to take care of the very poor is great and very socially acceptable. However, it can have its negative impacts as well. For example Black community in the 1950's was prosperous, had a higher number in the preservation of the family and community even while living in the horrid conditions of Jim Crow Laws. Today decades of politicians giving ""hand outs"" has actually created a community that is in a horrible and unstable conditions. for example 72%! of single motherhood in the black community! not only that the unjust laws and regulations over drugs has caused a massive amount of incarceration into the community. If social welfare is so good why has it caused such a negative affect in not only the black but white community as well.

So you're right that UBI is decent idea. But the way it is implemented in Yang's proposal is bad. For one, it's advertised as a way to make up for jobs lost to automation. But why does Yang consider automation an inevitability? Why does he consider people losing their jobs and livelihoods and entire neighborhoods collapsing just something we have to accept and live with?

Clearly the real problem here isn't the automation, but the fact that it is being used by capitalists to basically make more money for themselves at any cost to the communities it will destroy. It is just like the trade deals that shipped jobs overseas. Capitalist exploitation is seen as natural, inevitable, totally justifiable and not to be looked at in moral terms.

We need to understand that we can change how we look at automation and the market. It's not necessarily out of our control. We can make it so that the workers and the communities, not capitalists, decide how automation is implemented. And we can make it so that we the workers and communities benefit from automation (work less, make more) instead of just capitalists.

The other reason the UBI is bad is because, again, it's falsely advertised as giving us ownership of the economy, but it doesn't do that. It gives us a tiny, flat dividend that doesn't actually give us any control or actual ownership of our work. We could have a UBI or a wealth fund tied to the stock market, the way Norway does, and that would give us a lot more in return than just $12k a year, depending on how much ownership we have. And it would actually curb the power of the elite class by limiting their financial power and giving us direct control over the economy.

And because it's just a small flat fee we're getting, it doesn't actually help people like it claims. What is a truck driver, making a decent wage, going to do with $12k a year? Especially when the small stores that might have hired him also shut down in small towns because the economy was based on serving truck drivers? If Yang's prediction is true, we are looking at mass upheaval and people will need more than just a small pay-off to survive. We need the public sector to step in, like it did during the depression, to get us out of this rut. We can't keep relying on ""entrepreneurship.""

Also, you're right that there is an inequality of opportunity (and of all different sorts) in America. But that is *because* of capitalism. Capitalism was bourn out of a concentration of resources and wealth within a small class of people (what Marx called ""primitive accumulation""). And this continues to happen all the time.

429,"You'd be right if you didn't do this literally every single time it comes up, it's not a deflection. It's a genuine question. And the fact you post here a lot means less than nothing.

 I've seen plenty of people who object to the far left wing. That is understandable, and they often have good reasons for saying this. Criticisms like ""the vanguard party only becomes its own class"", or ""how will anarchists organize societies with billions of people in a gift economy?"" or whatever. Those are discussions to be had.

But when you take a post like the guy's above literally saying ""I want more representation and democracy and less violence"" you say he's taking the nuance out of the situation and making apologia for Stalin and Mao, even though most modenr socialists do not idolize them and in fact often have beliefs in direct opposition to them. The guy also wasn't writing a novel; it's not his responsibility to educate you or others on the specifics of his ideals because he isn't trying to convince you.

You then proceed to make the ""muh jobs"" argument, which is meaningless in a realized socialist state as jobs wouldn't affect someone's ability to provide for themselves. And before you say ""lel socialists have no idea how economy works 50% cannibalism XDDDD"" I'd invite you to consider that Universal Basic Income and the modern conception of welfare were proposed by conservatives. Also, defending an aspect of the economy saying change for the betterment of public welfare would be an economic impediment is almost verbatim what slaveowners said in the south, and what industrialists said about unions. Understand that when you make that utilitarian argument it's going to fall on deaf ears.

 You also ignore the very real issue of American (and other) police being armed with military equipment, and not, say, being totally stripped of lethal weapons and giving the weapons to purpose-trained specialists. Many/most socialists support the dissolution of the modern police force and their replacement with small-scale community run initiatives. Socialists and socialist subs on this site also *overwhelmingly* support Black Lives Matter, you're just assuming they don't act on it because ""lel commie teens"".

Beyond even that, you create a false dichotomy between the Democrats and Republicans, falsely saying the Republicans are more violent, conveniently ignoring stuff like the Bay of Pigs invasion/CMC (*which was the closest we've ever been to a nuclear war*), The Korean War and Vietnam War (where LBJ made it possible for himself to bypass congress, and send 50,000 american soldiers and 1 million Vietnamese to their deaths, bypassing democracy), ironically directly removing nuance from political opinions. You don't need to oppose the Republicans with the Democrats, even if the system is designed to try and make it that way. Socialists will not, and should not, support the party that directly called them ""unamerican"" in a national convention speech that lumped them together with fascists. Allowing your agenda to be pursued on your enemies' terms is foolhardy. At most, expect a few to vote democrat in states where Trump can conceivably win like Florida.

Your criticism of NK is also nonsensical, as they are neither communist nor do they even pretend to follow communist ideology. They even directly removed references to it from their constitution :P And again, you're ignoring socialist doctrines like permanent revolution which say that socialism confined to one or a few nations is doomed to fail. But you don't know anything about this so yeah, cannibalism or whatever.

It's so absurd it's bordering on parody. [And it's even worse since you said virtually the exact same thing a few days ago to a socialist on cb2 and got trounced](https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke2/comments/56i7ni/cuba_is_totally_a_paradise_and_human_rights_watch/d8joe6p).

445,"I completely agree that there is more depth and nuance to the conversation. That's why I was pointing out that ""taxing automation all to hell"" wasn't going to solve it. 

Fundamentally I think that automation taking all the jobs is a good thing. Understanding that it won't take ""all the jobs"", but for simplicity I leave it replacing general labor. If we were to support the move to automation rather than actively resist it, it would pull that bandaid faster. People who would otherwise occupy those automated roles now would have unlimited free time and there's a lot that a society can do with free time. But the way our society works, is if you don't have a job you don't have the ability to support yourself and others financially. UBI would theoretically solve that. 

We wanted everybody to be able to afford to go to college and so we provided government assistance. Then college got more expensive, as an example. Assuming we manage to implement UBI, people now have baseline guaranteed income, and someone is going to want to find a way to siphon that off too. Knowing that, we might try to implement upfront controls. That means more regulation, something that a significant portion of the country, including the wealthiest portion, might not want to encourage even if we could get everyone on board with UBI. 

There are other issues with UBI, even if we find a way to prevent those problems. The UBI would only really matter to those that no longer have work, even if everyone got it. Everyone not displaced by automation would still have better access to all the amenities that promote further success. Better education, better healthcare, better food, better social supports in richer neighborhoods. That risks furthering the class divide. Now we're talking about solving poverty, healthcare, education... Comprehensive solution for a comprehensive problem? We can't even get the country to agree on a single direction on any one of them. Let alone all of them. 

If automation hits as hard as everyone seems to think it might, it's going to hit us like a train. We're not ready.

We get that money as a partial payout of the 5 year average of the fund and it is not meant to solely pay the people. It was created as a wealth fund to support the state when we ran out of oil.

Alaska is also unique due to the fact that we, as a people, own the natural resources in the state.  Not the feds, but the natives and the state.  That is how we justified the PFD.

People much smarter than yourself and I, strongly believe that some sort of UBI is needed. What works and what doesn’t, we don’t know until we try and start to learn the effects. Like every other scientific study, you need more than one to draw a conclusion. 

Here’s also the rest you forgot :P

Finland undertook its experiment for the wrong reasons. Using the universal basic income to increase labor market participation and phase out some benefits is like swatting flies with a sledgehammer. In a report on the future of work released earlier this month, the World Bank recommended the much more ambitious goal of considering UBI as a means of ensuring a “societal minimum” of welfare in a world of increasingly precarious employment and growing automation. If a society is to accept much higher taxes to pay for a basic income plan, it has to be for a revolutionary outcome, not a mere bump in employment numbers and a dent in the cost of social security administration.

Low UBI-like payments aren’t even likely to work well for the purposes KELA had in mind. Neither dividends from the Alaska Permanent Fund, which paid every state resident $1,100 for 2017, nor Iran’s one-year experiment, in 2011, with paying 96 percent of its population $45 a month, had any effect on employment. The Finnish program, of course, pays more but also below subsistence level, so its outcome is likely to be similar.

The UBI idea is not dead. It’s still worth watching other experiments, especially the ones that actually provide a living income. These include Oakland, California, which pays $2,000 a month, almost exactly at the poverty line, and the one in Kenya, which pays $23 a month, about half the average income in the country’s rural areas. Other tests, in the Dutch city of Utrecht and an upcoming one in Ontario, Canada, offer low payouts relative to the living standard, but still higher than in the Finnish test.",Data analysis and research.,e50elao,"&gt; Did you read the article you just posted?

Yes.  It said the cost of this program if rolled out over the entire country would exceed Finland's entire national budget.  One program.  Would cost more than the entire program spending on everything their government does now.

&gt; That aside, Canada is very different than Finland and it is just crazy to draw the same conclusions.

Sorry, when you have a financial inequity to the magnitude mentioned in the above paragraph, one can very easily draw the same conclusion.

You may thing the government jumped the gun or is cold-hearted or whatever, but the fact remains: governments can't just give out vast sums of money to people.  They just can't.

Jobs are created at the intersection of supply and demand. No single group is the driver or creator of jobs; it is a market mechanism.

&gt;Consumption drives production. You automate production, and eliminate most production jobs - what do you have left? Consumption! If we're generating most of the value by consuming, it makes complete sense to get paid to consume, and for individuals to have the freedom to choose what they want to produce in their own time.

You can't consume something before it is produced.To say consumption drives production is vastly oversimplifying the interrelated nature of supply and demand.

&gt;Machine automation is pretty much the equivalent to slaves - or food falling from the sky. Why can't you acknowledge that simple fact?

No, it isn't. Secondly, you failed to see the point of the exercise, which was that hypothetical idyllic views of society should not be the basis of economic policy.

&gt;What costs? Electrical power from solar? If you can run a factory with 0 employees, what costs are you complaining about now? Imagine owning a 200 employee factory, automating everything, and then telling shareholders they shouldn't expect a dramatic revenue increase because ""there's still costs"". Think that would fly?

The costs of developing and implementing the automation for starters. Automation isn't just sitting there in the corner waiting for us to turn the switch on.

The costs of the UBI include the disincentive to work which means the disincentive to produce as well.

On the one hand, they have these views that value hard work and making a life for oneself without taking money from an entity like the government, but on the other hand, this mentality is exactly why the economy as it is. On a macroeconomic level, there will always be more workers than jobs in a stable economy. The employers will always have the upper hand.

Assume you're a Shell station owner. UBI goes out and you decide to try making more money by raising the price of goods. You try it with Snickers bars let's say. You pay $0.80 for each Snickers bar today and sell 300 bars each week priced at $1.25, netting $135 gross margin on chocolate bars per week. Let's say you raise your price to $1.75, a 60% increase, thinking you'll net $285 of gross margin on sales of 300 bars. Everything went okay for the first week or two, but what you didn't account for is that the grocery store across the street kept its price at $1.25, so over the next month their sales rose from 500 bars/week to 650 bars/week while yours dropped to 120 bars a week, netting you only $114 of gross margin, $21 less than before.

Now, you might think the grocery store will raise its prices too when it realizes the potential, but then every other retailer in the local area, and online, would have to raise their price on Snickers for that to work out for you. If a minority of businesses keep the prices lower then they will develop a reputation for it and people will go to those businesses for a good deal, making it hard to profit off a price increase. Consumer price sensitivity limits the returns from price increases, and this won't go away just because we have more money to spend. We all remember how much a Snickers cost last week. Especially with today's callout culture, people will know if businesses are disproportionately raising prices and could even boycott them for it.

If instead the manufacturer itself (Mars) decided to raise the price of Snickers, it would face a similar issue in that convenience stores could choose to drop the product if the price increase is unjustified, as there are many alternative candies on the market that they can offer on their shelves that will sell better at lower prices. Of course Snickers itself carries enough brand recognition that Mars may get away with this to some degree, but from their perspective it's the businesses procuring the candy bars, not the consumer, so consumers having extra money in their hands wouldn't directly impact their pricing decisions. Even if they try to take advantage of it, Mars may actually determine it's more likely to make extra money by dropping the price of Snickers to attract new customers or increase repeat sales with all the extra consumer dollars available, rather than raise prices and risk losing sales to competitor products in the booming candy market.","Living costs, Business and profit.",f1nknrz,"I think that the ""freedom dividend"" would cause mass inflation as the top 1% would use it as an excuse to raise the price on everything so they could grab as much of it as they could.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

481,I've been reading the latest articles on UBI by experts and enthusiasts for well over three years. I was interested before Yang even came on the political stage.

482,"&gt; How would that work?

An LVT (land value tax) would force land into use, which means idle land would become increasingly costly as opposed to increasing in value over time.  Worst case scenario, realtors would be forced to reduce their prices enough to house tenants (just to collect rent enough to cover LVT).  Best case scenario, they sell out to the state and we redistribute land through an auction system where people bid on the rent they're willing and able to pay.  As a result, we get people into homes and in areas generally proportional to their rent levels.

&gt; Can you give me more detail on that?

LVT is functionally a user fee for denying others the natural opportunities offered by land.  Let's say there is no more land outside of the city on which to build your own farm, say it's coastline or it's infertile, like you live in the far north or something.  That forces you into the workforce, purely because the existing establishment retains control of the land on which the only opportunities to employ your labor can be found.  LVT can, and originally is intended to be, cashed out in the form of a Citizen's Dividend (like a UBI), scaling with the gross land value denied to you in the form of rent.

Henry George specifically posited in *Progress and Poverty* that this money be funneled back into the community to reduce inequity, but he later elaborated that that money, being the product of value created by the community, could be, if the community willed it, spent of auxilliary purposes such as the social programs suggested by people like Thomas Paine; retirement pensions, coverage for people unable to work, and the like.

The key distinction here is that said policies would be funded collectively, through the creation of land value (and the taxation on it), as opposed to individually, through the product of labor (and the taxation on it).  This merest distinction would eliminate the biggest argument the right-wing has against social policies, leaving only the merits of the each individual social policy to determine whether it lives or dies.","- Living costs

Non sequitur. UBI amounts to non-workers stealing from workers. It's easy to see who benefits from that.

Then it would be stupid to do since there's nothing to gain from it. It'd be like sitting around a table where each person puts $1000 in the middle and then takes $1000 back.

&gt;UBI would be also like a fund so people can use it to create new companies and new enterpraises so more competition can enter the market, the benefits would pay the cost of UBI by long.

No they wouldn't because they'd have to pay extra tax to fund the UBI in the first place, leaving them with less money to create new companies and new enterprises. This is the same problem as mentioned above.","- Automation and jobs

489,"&gt; I don't know why you're trying to correct me on the definition of poverty. Does this matter?

Yes it does. Because that was my initial point. The foundation of your argument is that the minimum wage benefits teens who want to buy more weed and not *actual* poor people. My argument was that the poverty line is significantly understated, and therefore undermines the data about who would be benefited by a minimum wage hike among those who should be viewed as impoverished. 

Let's also not forget that if a large portion of minimum wage recipients are 24 or younger (those damn kids - get off my lawn! No wage increase for you!) that many of those individuals fall into one of two categories: living on their own and no less impoverished than someone older than 24, or supported by family members and therefore draining on their family's resources. Hell, 1 in 10 CalState students is *homeless*.

&gt; Instead of addressing the vast majority of those in poverty (62%) you choose to focus on the 3% of full time employed people (of whom, you don't even know if they make minimum wage). 

Now who's being disingenuous. The fact that I pointed out the need to modify the poverty line is demonstrative of me NOT focusing solely on that group. It (minimum wage) just happens to be the one issue of discussion here. 

Your argument, again, is that the minimum wage increase doesn't help enough people so we should do it at all. Which again, brings me back to the cancer drug analogy. 

I personally support eliminating welfare cliffs, instituting a national UBI/NIT, increasing social security benefits, and more. But please, do tell me how I'm focused on ""the 3% of full time employed people (of whom, you don't even know if they make minimum wage).""",Labor wages and work conditions.,dby4ket,"&gt; And perhaps they shouldn't be.

I agree with you. So how do you fix it? By paying a bunch of teenagers more money?

Minimum wage DOES NOT TARGET the poor people.

You don't even know of those 12% make minimum wage or even &lt;10.50 or whatever the new min wage is suppose to be. How will you help them if they're in poverty but make more than 10.50 or work a salaried job? 

&gt;You're just making the same argument again and adding in a false dilemma.

You are completely disingenuous in your argument. I'm saying you can't help poor people with minimum wage and I have provided a lot of evidence for why. Most impoverished people don't work. no amount of minimum wage increase will help these people. 

Instead of addressing the vast majority of those in poverty (62%) you choose to focus on the 3% of full time employed people (of whom, you don't even know if they make minimum wage).

America is NOT only the right.  We need solutions that work for all Americans, and sometimes that means compromise.  We need solutions that can unify even those at the extremes.  

For example, if you don't like corporations, great, here's $1000 for you to build your own worker owned company and you can set up your profit sharing however you want.  Get 30 employees, and all of a sudden your company has $30,000 every month to build your company.  You can make your own union and bargain with yourself.  All of that leftist belief can be supported through the FD.  If you don't believe in capitalism, then you can operate the business as a neutral entity, neither earning or losing anything, and everyone can make $1000 a month from the operation of the business.  You would probably have significant market share as you can now undercut your pricing for every consumer.  Win for your social democracy and win for capitalism, too.

All at the same time, the FD will empower conservatives to moving toward their agenda.  By infusing more capital into the consumer side, we can start reducing government expenses on various programs, whether it be welfare, housing, state subsidies, etc.  By providing a freedom dividend that does not add to the deficit, we can start looking for real solutions to balancing a budget and reducing debt without disproportionately affecting the less fortunate while doing so.

This is entirely why several candidates have begun to rationalize the effects of UBI.  Pete laughed at Yang at the debate, but spoke at a forum in March that 'looking into' UBI as a set of solutions was viable.  Castro and Gabbard both agreed that UBI was a solution focused policy.  Booker agreed, but wanted Yang to jump aboard his $15 minimum wage - Yang showed that the FD is over a $6, tax free, hourly increase for someone working four 40 hours weeks.  Marianne has publicly supported Yang's UBI proposal.  Biden talks as if he's Yang on talkshows, speaking about automation/etc.  All it takes is for Bernie and Warren to hop aboard, and Yang pretty much convinces every DNC candidate.

If, and once, Yang gets to #1 or #2 in the polls, we'll see that come to fruition.  Every Yang naysayer, Bernie Bro, or other democrat will all of a sudden support his plan using the very same talking points they use now to try and dismiss it.  Conservatives like me will support it, but we'll still have some who vote by party line (and even some democrats who defect).  If Bernie, or Warren, or even others are the nominee, we will have a fairly divided country still on our hands even if they eek out the presidency.  Even if democrats hold the house, senate and presidency, there will be 2 years to make changes before the next roll call happens.  Yang's signature platform, the FD, is the one policy that can gain enough support to be implemented, and the results will be immediately available to determine it's success or failure.

&gt;The people without will get a 1000, rent in most coastal cities is so high - you can get a room for 800. That leaves nothing for living. This person is well still stuck with no plan for the future. 

That scenario is based on the assumption that said person has 0 income and living in an $800 room. In this scenario is... he/she would already be kicked out if not soon. The $1000 would be a good start for that road/bus trip to somewhere else where he/she can at the very least... find a part time job.

But a more likely scenario, he/she has a low paying job and is just barely making the $800 rent. In this scenario, the $1000 will go a long way. Still has the option for that road trip ;)

&gt;People who do get UBI will likely spend it all away without planning - for example the YangGang anthem makes it seem like people want government to give them money so they can buy weed. 

I have no doubt that some will blow it all. But believe it or not, many do have plans and aspirations (especially when they hit their 30s and 40s). But in their current situation, can't afford to buy a home, or pay for that $500 car repair, or sign up their kid for soccer club, or make sure their kids have enough to eat, or buy their 16 year old a working vehicle, or pay off that debt (this one is the priority for most of my... less fortunate friends). Yes, some will probably set aside the last $200 to buy their monthly weed.

&gt;Yang gives example of a truck driver. A truck driver makes \~ $50K per year. Thats &gt; $4k per month. If he doesn't have a job and you give him $1k, I don't see how that helps. 

So imagine said trucker lives in a small town of 30000 adults. Each getting $1000/month. In addition to the existing economy, now there's an *extra* $30m/month in the local economy. Mechanics are going to get busier because now people can have those $500 repairs done. Bakers will sell more croissants and avocado toasts. Salons will get more business. Farmers can sell fancier vegetables. etc.

So said trucker now has options. He/she can be a mechanic, or bake, or style hair, or farm. If he/she doesn't like any of that, and always wanted to weld (or bake cupcakes or whatever), he/she can start an etsy page to sell metal art and/or an ebay page to sell jeep/bronco/blazer parts. So now... he/she is pursuing his/her passion and that passion becomes the supplement to the $12k/year. We forget about his/her partner, who's been home taking care of the kids making $0, he/she will also get $1000/month. That household now has $24k/year + welding (or mechanicing or baking or hairstyling) money.

525,"I would contend with your assertion that life is better now post-american capitalism. Colonialism has destroyed countless cultural practices, communities and lives, and the inequality we see in third world countries can still be traced back to the relatively recent European invasions of the Indian subcontinent, the majority of the African continent and South and Central America. 

I'm not claiming that before European invasion all places were lovely and idyllic, but Europe in recent history has benefited and continues to benefit off of the exploitation of ""developing"" countries. So it may not be completely true to say that things are better for a vast number of people. For instance; the millions of people living in poverty in Sao Paulo may not be living safer or more fulfilling lives than their ancestors. 

There's also *some* evidence for people continuing to be motivated to work even when basic necessities are provided for under UBI. Although this has only been tested on a small scale and so it would be irresponsible to suggest a small sample size would apply to a wider population. 

In terms of alternatives to the two systems, there's the combination of capitalism and socialism, have the government interfere in economics with taxes, breaking up monopolies and providing state funded services, sometimes *Democratic Socialism*, that you can see in a number of European countries that provide healthcare, education, etc.

You also have Libertarian Socialism (Anarcho Communism) which is what the Spanish briefly set up during the civil war, before the Soviet involvement and defeat by Franco and the Fascists (good name for a band). Where the private ownership of housing was continued, land was redistributed, and the approach to economics was small scale communalism. There is also an emphasis direct democracy rather than the representative democracy/skewed first past the post voting system we see in the US and the UK. 

We don't know how successful that would have been, as it was destroyed before too long, but a move away from concentration of power in any capacity (the rich 1%, the state, Fascists like Franco) appears to allow for less inequality. Although on a practic scale it's hard to say as there are no long running example of such a system.

It’s quite refreshing and exceedingly rare these days for people to respond to an opinion on politics, equality, etc without name calling and finger wagging. 

I couldn’t agree more that there may be a better way to design an economy than pure capitalism or communism/facism, but I’m not currently aware of any. 

To me, when modeling an economic system, you must look closely at the philosophical nature of humans in general. By and large, most people don’t seem to be self-motivated in my opinion. You and I may be to some extent but there are an awful lot of people who would be perfectly content to sit around and do nothing but watch TV and play video games all day, every day. The 2 economic systems were discussing here attempt to motivate people to use their energy to produce something. Capitalism basically says, ‘hey you there, chilling on the couch all day, if you’re willing to put in some effort, get educated and work hard, you can live a pretty nice life, maybe even a fantastic life’. Communism/fascism on the other hand says ‘hey you lazy piece of shit, get your ass to your assigned factory job right now or we’ll lock your ass up’.  I don’t know about you, but I prefer having the freedom to chose what I want to do versus being told what to do while looking down the barrel of a gun. 

Sure, there are going to be some people in a capitalist system who are simply unable to work due to disability or illness and that’s why welfare/safety nets systems are in place. There are also going to be those who fare better in this system than others, in some cases FAR better but so what? That doesn’t directly impact anyone else’s ability to go out and earn a living themselves. 

As far as the non-western/non-asian countries where large scale suffering continues to exist, how is successful capitalism in the wealthier areas negatively impacting them? I don’t have the research but I would venture to guess that the people from the majority of those areas have been suffering in one way or another for far longer than the any supposed negative effects from capitalism have been impacting them.

What I’m ultimately trying to say is that if you look at the world as a whole from pre-american capitalism to now, I think you’ll have to admit that things are far better for a vast number of people now than before. We take a lot of things that capitalism has given us for granted because we don’t know any different.",0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I think a permanent shelter is a bad solution to homelessness, as it implies it's okay for people to be permanently homeless. If you want to prioritize this problem, there are better solutions, like universal health care in the short term(including mental health) and basic income in the very long term. So far, basic income is the only solution I see to ubiquitous automation. In say 50 years, I'd like everyone to get a basic income of say, 1/3 the median individual income, funded by a tax proportional to income over that threshold. Right now I'd say lock the increase the income tax threshold to 1/3 the median income and a basic income 2% of that number, increasing by 2% per year.

That is true.  And I have no way of knowing for the same reasons. ∆

&gt;Again, speaking personally: Libertarian terms like ""limited government"" or ""economic freedom"" have absolutely no positive emotional impact on me. I hear that and I'm just eh. So when I talk to someone who values those things on their own merit, there's a way in which it doesn't matter if they're Gary Johnson or Ayn Rand: in a way, they're speaking Greek to me.

[Rand herself called libertarianism a greater threat to freedom than modern liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism#Objectivism), so I don't know why her views keep getting propped up as speaking for libertarians.  

So you hear some terms that don't impact you emotionally and you stop listening?  That is what I would be talking about.  There are other terms associated with libertarians and the current Libertarian candidate, like ""protect the environment,"" ""basic income,"" ""end corporate subsidy,"" and ""non-interventionist foreign policy,"" that maybe sound more like English to you (totally projecting what terms might appeal to you), but you can't hear it because you already went ""eh.""

Only you know if that's true, I'm just saying that it looks similar from the outside.

&gt; I can agree with that. However, I don't think Gary Johnson is one of the horrible loud libertarians, yet the things he says are just as easily dismissed.

I recognize that Johnson is different from the kinds of people I'm talking about.  But speaking personally, I have just as easy a time dismissing his views.  He wants to deregulate more than I think would be a good idea; he inherently values privatization and economic free marketism more than I do... I don't need to caricature him to recognize he's not up my alley.

&gt; value compassion above all else? Does that mean other people can't? Are compassion and freedom really at odds with each other? Saying Republicans value sanctity paints them all as religious which I don't think is true either.

First of all, just as an aside, sanctity doesn't necessarily imply religion.  (I won't get into my personal theory that many millennial so-called libertarians are actually just non-religious conservatives who think that's a paradox.)

Anyway, what I said is definitely an oversimiplification, and these values are NOT in conflict much or most of the time... and everyone values all three, to some extent.  But I support what I said that that's what'll shake out when you DO have to choose.

528,"Exactly, the only thing is that remember that you might already have some deductions additional to your RRSP (like the basic income amount, and others). So adding 48k wouldn't lower your taxable amounts further, and you would be wasting the RRSP room for the years when you have more income. Additionally, when you withdraw the money, you will have to pay tax on it, and part of it will be withheld on withdrawal (10% up to 5,000, 20% up to 15,000, and 30% from there). Because a big part of your 48k is within the lowest tax bracket (15% on the first $45,282 of taxable income), you are going to be taxed similarly on it on withdrawal.

VAT + UBI is a net gain for everyone except those that *spend more than 10,000/month. Items that are staple goods (ie: grocery items such as milk and eggs) are exempt to this. The biggest spenders in our economy are the rich, and they spend so much money on luxery items such as fancy vehicles, yahts, plane tickets, designer clothes, jewelery, wine rooms.. etc. Which will bring in way more revenue and not hurt anyone. This combined with the fact that the VAT captures supply chain transactions (ie business to business) is where we see the flow of capital change in this country. 

The corporations are the big winners these days and are the ones holding most of the wealth. VAT is way more effective at successfully redirecting this than a wealth tax as proven by it's failure in Europe.

But this thread has helped a lot so far, as has the subreddit. The sub was actually the whole reason why I wanted to do something on basic income to begin with. =)",Data analysis and research.,cfwbxcu,"Two sites you should be using already are google scholar and your university's research database, which is usually available through the library's web portal.

Part of the issue is that you've taken on a fairly tough subject to get research on. There are certainly economists who are interested in this (I am a researcher, and I've recently started thinking about this topic), but there are political forces in academia that might preclude writing on the subject. The main problem is not that economists will be politically ostracized or called commies or something - it's that researching things that most people see as unlikely or irrelevant will make you look less serious to your peers. I'm not saying this topic is irrelevant - only that it is perceived that way.

That being said, as an economist, I would advise you to develop your own arguments based on research into similar subjects. For instance, [here](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1801842) is a paper discussing the economic impacts of minimum wage policies. If I were writing your paper I would start there and say something like, ""The minimum wage is a well studied area of economics, and we can use some of this knowledge to predict likely impacts of a basic income policy."" There are other topics that might lend themselves to your subject as well, such as the economics of subsidies, developmental economics, and data from Sweden, which has a very extensive social welfare system.

While I think these will get you moving in the right direction, your final argument needs to be your own. You can't expect to just cite other people who did your thinking for you - you need to show your ability to apply theory and data to your own thesis.

In summary, I will leave you with the following pieces of advice that I give to all of my students:

1. Identify Winners and Losers. Every economic policy modifies the distribution of resources. If you find yourself talking about all the ways a policy will help people, and never mention who the policy will hurt, then you are being intellectually dishonest or careless in your thinking. It's fine to say, ""These people will be hurt, and here's why that's ok."" But if you find yourself being dismissive of the 'losers' in your policy prediction, then you need to step back and gain some perspective. For instance, a policy might hurt the wealthiest .5% of Americans, and you might say, ""That's ok because they are rich."" This is wrong, because it disregards that group's rights to equal treatment. It's better to say, ""This will hurt the top .5% of earners, however, over the last 30 years this group has made disproportional gains compared against the middle class, and so while enacting a policy that attempts to redress that imbalance might be hurtful to those earning 2.5 million dollars and more, the greater social good will come from having a more equal wealth distribution."" Which brings me to my next point...

2. Make the distinction between normative and positive statements, and justify your normative statements with data. A positive statement is one which simply addresses quantifiable, 'objective' forces and seeks to understand them. A normative statement is one which places value judgments on a situation. Normative statements are fine to make, but you need to give actual data justifying your position. I see lots of students say things like, ""This will be better because [everyone knows that] women earn less than men."" Instead, the student needs to take the time to understand why they think women earn less than men, identify the specific forces involved in that inequality, and provide data demonstrating that the situation that they find undesirable would be addressed by the policy they are proposing.

3. Don't look for people agreeing with you. Make your original argument (thesis statement) first - something like, ""A basic minimum income provided to all Americans would improve the quality of living, eliminate poverty, and provide minimal risk to our economic stability and prosperity."" After that, don't go looking to prove your belief. **Go looking for things that show you why you are wrong.** A lot of times students are afraid to identify sources that disagree with them, worrying that they'll end up being 'wrong.' That's the thing, though - in science, there is no such thing as being right. The entire idea is that you will make a claim (hypothesis) and then try to show that it's wrong. If you can't do that after giving it an *honest* go, then it *might* be right. Only after you have tried to invalidate your position should you look for data suggesting why your thesis is likely to be more true than alternative theses. If you go about this the other way round, you end up simply confirming your own pre-conceived notions, then building strawman arguments against it to create the illusion of objectivity.

4. It is ok to be wrong. You might do research and end up being like, ""I really thought this would be the case, but it turns out that the data show something else."" Believe it or not, as a professor, these are the **best papers to read**. They show us that students approached the subject with an open mind and learned something. You shouldn't go out of your way to write a paper like this, but when one comes along, don't run away from it. Embrace your wrongness and explain, in detail, why you were wrong. At the end of the day, **education is about continual self-exploration, and challenging/changing ourselves**, not necessarily changing the world around us.

5. Evaluate the credibility of your sources. This is a mistake lots of students make that destroys their papers. If you cite a source, they need to be credible. Any jackass on the street can write a paper and put it on the internet - that doesn't mean they have an educated or informed position. Many times, *especially* in economics and policy, someone is just a very compelling writer with little or no facts, data, or rational justification for their argument. It's easy to be convincing. It's difficult to actually do science (see also; Rand, Ayn). Additionally, lots of private interests write very complicated papers with math and figures and tons of data that can seem very serious, while still being intellectually bankrupt. This is **very common** in economic policy debates, because lobbyists and corporations pay millions to have think tanks produce reports justifying their position. This is not science, and if you use these sorts of sources in your work, you will get obliterated. Main rule - if it ain't peer-reviewed, avoid it like the plague.

Lots of people like to think that economics or other social sciences are 'soft' and involve people sitting around stroking their beards while postulating over coffee and clove cigarettes. They confuse modern social science, which is heavily quantitative and has a rich body of testable theory, with its roots in Philosophy. There are many reasons this is the case, primarily that when we teach economics or sociology or political science we start with the philosophers whose observations and arguments were foundational to our discipline (Locke, Hume, Mill, Smith, etc.). It's a more intuitive entry point than presenting someone with a mathematical model and data and showing how the model predicts the data and why the model functions. I see a lot of students really internalize this notion, though, and decide that it's all bullshit and solipsism. So they write papers trying to persuade me of how they are really smart with their philosophical treatise on why personal responsibility would eliminate poverty or some bullshit. The reality of social science and policy is that they are grounded in a pragmatic attempt to explain society through real scientific research and good data. Start with that attitude and you will be way better off.

Hope this helps. I know you requested actual sources, but I think it's important for students to learn how to use research tools (particularly academic databases) so I'll leave that up to you.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I actually see the future of the Republican party looking kind of like Andrew Yang, all be it, without the sensible liberalism that he has. UBI is a great regulation for Conservatives since it looks like it's supporting the working class, but gives them ample support to cut spending in other areas. We've actually seen what UBI looks like in a Conservative government - the governor of Alaska just used it as a cudgel to half the funding of Alaska's University system. I think fiscal Conservatism will fall to a more ""sensible spending"" brand of Conservatism. Less about cutting all costs, but focusing on a few key programs while making everything else seem superfluous. Think support for the military budget.

544,"I mean yah but what I mean is the main issue people have when they loose a job is loosing their income, made even worse by the scant social safety net. Not the lack of fulfillment, though that's a side effect depending on how nice or not the job was. Most low end jobs aren't exactly fulfilling and some are downright degrading.Survival is generally the biggest most pressing concern over loosing a job. 

At least in America those loans are very limited and capped at 6k max a year unless you're parents have good credit. Not enough in most states to pay in state tuition for public uni's, let alone living costs. And the interest rates are quite high so it becomes pretty extortionary and a huge burden around one's neck. And the tuition and rent costs just keep skyrocketing. We already have the issue where prices just increase across the board to keep the lowest priced class out of a decent live, at least in 
America. 

And when it comes to basic income it may not be perfect but I really don't see a whole lot of alternatives. It's inevitable that there will be less and less jobs, especially middle class jobs, to go around as automation increases. And the new job fields created almost never make up for the jobs lost, automation is highly efficient and replaces significantly more  jobs than it creates, otherwise it wouldn't be profitable. And not to mention that a worker in retail or at a factory or in a hotel is unlikely to be able to become say a high end programmer for Google studying deep learning and Ai. Very few people can really work in silicon Valley type jobs. And even tech jobs will become more competitive and harder to get as automation removes lower end/redundant tech work and the competition increases for the remaining good jobs. 

Anyway so the point is that there will be a future most likely where there simply isn't enough jobs to go around for everyone, especially jobs that could support a family and a middle class life. We're arguably already there and it'll just get worse.
So imo you could either go with full socialism and distribute the wealth and remaining work equally, which could work but obviously would be hard to implement and has its own issues. Or you could go full free market capitalist and just leave people to fend for themselves which would obviously end badly and in a lot of death and probably in revolts and revolution. Or you could give people a basic income and a set standard of living so that no one has to suffer and worry about survival. To not guarantee survival seems barbaric and you can't just ask everyone to retrain into jobs that don't exist in enough numbers or are not realistic for a worker to be able to do. Though with basic income any possible retraining would be much morw achievable 

And obviously the gov would also have to institute price controls to keep things affordable and preferably build public housing like in Singapore where 80% live in high quality public housing and the average income is around 80k.

Anyway I wrote a lot but I'd be genuinely interested to hear what you would say should be done about this incoming crisis.

In the industrial revolution, pay was a pittance, and companies offered to pay for low quality tenement housing and two meals a day in lieu of a reasonable income. That created extreme dependency on factory owners and entrenched poverty, which only began to end once the social order changed and factory workers were given the right to vote. As a kid, you were dependent on your parents for food (which is natural and fine). But the allowance, which you did not earn, gave you responsibility, freedom, and opportunity.

This was actually studied in many places already. There is a major UBI study [being undertaken in Kenya, ](http://www.businessinsider.com/basic-income-study-kenya-redefining-nature-of-work-2018-1)and indicators show that it is having a positive effect on improving social welfare. A [UBI study in Alaska ](https://qz.com/1205591/a-universal-basic-income-experiment-in-alaska-shows-employment-didnt-drop/)shows that UBI does not create a cycle of dependency, and does not reduce opportunity - rather the opposite.

&gt;From the study:   
&gt;  
&gt;The study examining the Alaska Permanent Fund calls this into  question. The $60.1-billion state fund, established in 1976, collects  revenue from Alaska’s oil and mineral leases to fund an annual stipend  to Alaskans. Since 1982, the fund has sent a dividend check to every  Alaskan resident. In recent years,  its been up to $2,072 per person, or  $8,288 for a family of four (it was reduced in 2016 amid a budget  crisis).  
&gt;  
&gt;Alaska’s system set up an ideal experiment. Researchers from the  University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania compared  residents’ behavior before and after the dividend to decide what effect  the payments had on workforce participation.  
&gt;  
&gt;They found that full-time employment did not change at all, and the  share of Alaskans who worked part-time jobs increased by 17&amp;#37;.

I can't speak for where you live, but here they have one employee keeping an eye on 4-8 self checkout lanes. Simply standing by in case something goes wrong. 1 person doing this where if they wanted these 4-8 lanes open before, they'd need 4-8 employees working. So now they don't need so many, they have two options.

1) Lay off a bunch of the cashiers

2) Reduce hours of cashiers

In theory, they could also assign them different jobs, but realistically, a lot of these jobs are already filled and you'll either see that happen with one or two still effecting part of or the entire store.

In situation 1, a number of people would now need to go find new jobs elsewhere. Keep in mind, this self-checkout and general automation of jobs thing isn't just a grocery store/walmart thing, it's happening everywhere. A growing population and shrinking job market means those who lose the jobs they have to machines are going to have a harder time finding a new one. People take jobs they're overqualified for because it pays more than social welfare and they can take pride in not feeling like they're a drain on the system. 

In situation 2, all people working for the company are being paid less, the slice of pie pie (overall number of available hours) that workers get is smaller, while the few people up top get more. On top of this, people may be move from full-time positions to part-time positions, resulting in a loss of benefits. Cost for taking care of basic needs goes up and the money in the bank goes down.

So what's the bigger picture? Just like how real estate can be a buyers market or a sellers market (if more people are trying to sell than buy real estate goes down because sellers have to convince you that their place is the better deal whereas a sellers market is more potential buys than available housing results in bidding wars) job markets can favour employees or employers. Advancements in technology and booming populations are shifting power into the hands of the companies. They can start offering less money, less benefits, less flexible hours because a bigger pool of potential employees means they're more likely to find someone willing to take it. Jobs go to the lowest bidder, and buddy gets left in the cold because he couldn't go lower and still be able to feed his family. Those who do get jobs are typically receiving a minimum wage that's lower than the cost of living. Where I live, cost of living for the basics is about $25,000 a year, this covers food, rent, and clothes, like TV? Want a cellphone? Have student loans to pay off? Cost goes up. Minimum wage pays about $20,000 a year. Notice an issue here?

In a country that has the social support structures in place to deal with this (universal healthcare, universal basic income, etc). This can be dealt with, but those ideas have only really taken off in Europe, Canada is flirting with the idea of UBI, but as of right now it's only scheduled for a trial in Ontario and meeting with a lot of opposition from what Harper would call the ""Old Stock Canadians"". 

The simple fact of the matter is that machines are taking the places of people, people are being left without jobs to pay for the basic costs of living, those who do have jobs may not even be able to afford the cost of living, and the government isn't doing a damn thing about it. This means we have to. Force the companies to hire people, all you have to do is stand in line for a few minutes. Take out your cellphone and browse facebook or something.

As for what the mods can do, would you consider creating maybe a weekly policy sticky thread? Pick one of the policies that maybe gets less attention, copy and paste from his policy page, maybe link if there's a relevant video, and then just let people discuss it there.

I know talking about policies online isn't canvassing and it isn't phone banking, so it might seem like encouraging unproductive activity.

Concern trolling is even better b/c it's subtle and difficult to argue most of the time.  Users don't usually even mark these posts as spam.

Most people on here value the open dialog that afforded our growth, but then get upset when it's the ""wrong kind"" of open dialog, I can understand that.  My entire intention in fostering this environment was that we were a community that needed to engage in discussion with curious people since Andrew and our ""movement"" had no history or established core beliefs.  I allow basic trolling because I felt we needed to steel ourselves against outside arguments and use this sub as a training ground for the real world.  I wanted us to build up an immune system, not be trapped in an echo-chamber bubble that would weaken us and serve as an opium den.

While I agree that the anxiety level here is getting pretty elevated, and the amount of frustration we hold as a community isn't producing healthy communication, I'm at a loss as to how best address it with the time afforded to me.  You want every post that mentions another candidate to be removed? You want anything FUDish to be removed? You want every negative dissenting opinion to be removed?  Every comment that doesn't perfectly fit in, every inaccurate complaint about a PAC or a poll or whatever - that's just sterilized and removed?

There's how many comments on this thread, but zero comments on the phonebanking thread.  There were two entries for the phone-banking contest yesterday, which cost me 60$ and has no sponsors for the future.  We've failed to meet those daily goals for a full week now - nobody here's up in arms about it.  No campaign staff is telling people about it.  So here I am, working hard and coming up short in almost ever regard b/c I can't get people focused on what actually matters, and go to look at the board and it's 50 fuckin posts about how everyone OTHER THAN US is at fault for our failures.  It's the DNC! It's the MEDIA! It's the one-armed-man and his cousin!  Hundreds of posts about how crooked the system is, how unfair and upsetting and whatever else - but there are 10 PEOPLE MAKING CALLS.  TEN.

So what am I to do?  We're experiencing a lot of turbulence but people don't want to listen to the frustration of others b/c it's negative and often paranoid. That's acceptable, neither do I.  I want to make this a phonebanking-powered subreddit at this point, but who knows the amount of fallout that would cause.  I would like to tell everyone that complains about what some other subreddit is doing to STFU and keep your mind on your own house, including /r/politics, but almost every time I do something like that I get grief for it.

That removes cost for business. It's not like saved wages go into a UBI fund.

Now, in fairness (oh god, my bias will really show here), one can look at Switzerland to see how referendums can backfire.

Women couldn't vote until 1991*, because universal suffrage was decided by referendum--referendums in which only men could vote. Switzerland also voted against basic income through a referendum (77% against, actually) a few weeks ago, and banned the construction of minarets nationwide through a referendum in 2009.

\*-Well, in truth, it was February 1971 for federal elections. State-level elections are more complex; the first canton to allow women to vote in state elections was Vaud (the canton that Lausanne is in), in 1959. By the time there was universal suffrage in federal elections, and at that time about half the cantons had women's suffrage at the canton level, and by 1972 this spread to all but two cantons, Appenzell Ausserhoden and Appenzel Innerrhoden.

Prices go up, rents raised. Benefits go down because they go part time. Elimination of jobs because of increased costs. Literally the same.

Literally a UBI is circumventing the traditional trickle down economics. While 15 dollar minimum wage is truly a band aid and makes a person still a wage slave dependent on their corporate overlords.

Elimination of college debt? Do you know the percentage of people in this country that go to college or even graduate? UBI would address all of this.

Then you have a guaranteed job in what it has still yet to be determined, that ""may"" pay you better is pretty speculative.

Bernie was just answering  a question asked during an interview. First off let's talk about the pitfalls of Yang's vision for UBI and how that would impact us. Yang wants to implement UBI but isn't a heavy believer in governmental regulation so what's a possibility with Yang's UBI? Salary decreases, rent raised, and benefits slashed because the people in charge are taking into account that you're opting into this program. This also accounts for a secondary issue with UBI, it's an opt in program where you have to opt out of others (one of the most stunning being WIC). Yang has mentioned in interviews before that a goal of his is to make people dependent on opting into UBI and phasing out these programs altogether. This is an issue because it doesn't get at the root of systemic issues to begin with and eliminates federal assistance in exchange for cash. While we do deserve better programs than what we have currently, that's why Bernie is putting forward many universal programs rather than the mean tested ones we have currently. For example, welfare is not very popular while Medicare and Social Security are. Basically, there is no real guarantee that UBI will benefit Americans all that much in the long run and without any sort of regulation or accountability from the capitalist class it will cause people to stay just as poor as they were the month before.

Now let's talk about how Bernie can help you. Yang doesn't really believe in setting minimum wage at $15.00. I've heard a lot of complaints from Yang Gang because they talk about average cost of living but it belies the point that making minimum wage $15.00 will make salaries in general go up because of competition and in all likelihood your salary will go up too. With the elimination of college debt and the availability of free college if you no longer have debt you will be able to spend more money, and it will serve as an enormous economic stimulus package as well. This will increase the overall standard of living in the United States. With Sanders guaranteed jobs if you CHOOSE to do so, you can get a good paying job that will help rebuild American society that may in fact pay better than what you currently have. With Bernie's green new deal a great deal of governmental and war waste will be redirected into saving our planet. And with Medicare for All you will save money that you would have otherwise spent on copays and insurance. There's a lot more but this is only the surface and Bernie is still releasing proposals.

A system like that is welfare, which isn't what this is supposed to be - it's essentially economic injection into every state in the form of giving more power to the people rather than from the top down.

$1,000 a month to a rich person is instantly cancelled out due to their contributions to Yang's VAT plan being weighted against luxuries most consumed by the wealthier folk.

I want to add to this comment to make my argument (not because i think people here will disagree with it but because i want to make some copy pasta for later):

**I'm convinced the only reasons people have to support ICE are:**

1. They are misinformed about what ICE is and think they're customs agents. They're not, border security could be made stronger by allocating resources from ICE towards customs instead. ICE do not guard the border, it's just not their job.

2. They believe if we don't have ICE, terrorism will run wild. By allocating resources from ICE towards a better police force, we can do a better job at lowering the crime rates ICE is supposed to target but doesn't. Almost every high profile instance of terrorism in the US is because of terrorists over staying visas (many lived here for over 10 years already, and this is ignoring native born terrorists). ICE spends about 6 billion annually looking for terrorists that aren't even within their net, when we could be doing a much better job by allocating those resources to the police. Community policing works if you have the resources to train the police correctly. Additionally, by putting this money towards a basic income program, we can reduce crime rates as well.

I agree with you, but at some point the economy will be such that no matter how hard you work, there will be no job available. The idea behind giving people money isn't so that they don't have to work, it's to rebuild the economy so that we can start transitioning people into the jobs which will exist post automation.

Think about truck drivers. Right now, self driving trucks are an existential threat to them. If we don't help them through the transition, there could be mass protests where truckers stop highway traffic and cripple our logistic infrastructure. 

If they start receiving $1000/month now, maybe they won't feel so susceptible to self driving trucks. It'll give them the power to go back to school and seek out new opportunities. Or maybe they will go into their local community and become a coach for the little league team their child plays on. Or maybe they'll be able to take care of an aging relative.

Putting money directly into people's hands is not a way to make it so work is not necessary, it's a way to transition our economy into a more human based economy. An economy which places value on human relationships, team building, mentoring, leadership, volunteer work, etc. All studies on universal basic income have shown that most people do not decrease the amount of work that people do. The people who do lower their work hours are mostly mother's with young children, which I think we can both agree is some of the most valuable work in our society.

My point here is that we need to start changing the types of work that are economically viable. We should be celebrating that we're freeing people from the slavery of factories, truck driving, and other forms of menial labor. Right now the exact opposite is happening, where we have people who are essentially anti progress (see: people who park their trucks in Tesla charger spots because they feel threatened). Basic income is a way for us to transition away from old, dangerous, and menial forms of work to this new, more meaningful style of work which is still needed in a post automation world.

619,"&gt;Q2 :Why not prevent the worst damage entirely, right now?

Going backwards helps the logic flow here.

The use of fossil fuels is one of the biggest technology leaps in humankind.  It's up there with use of fire, agriculture, movable type, and computers.  If we don't have fossil fuels, the impact is brutal, and deadly.  Before plastics, hospital equipment used to have to be cleaned and re-used.  So plastics are preventing tens perhaps hundreds of millions of infections yearly.  Hundreds of millions more in the food industry.

Transportation isn't just travel.  It's getting life to places where life is difficult.  Food, health, housing, technology, all deeply involve fossil fuels.  I'm going to stop the benefits here:  I've seen 1,000 page reports that are incomplete on this issue.

Preventing the worst damage is going to cost lives.  In the amounts that the most extreme activists advocate?  Millions of lives.  Cost increases that threaten literally billions more, particularly in the developed world.

\&gt;  So there's companies polluting the environment, and you're suggesting that they have enough profit to both support a UBI **and** clean up the environment. 

The UBI isn't to increase people's lifestyle.  It isn't to 'help the poor'.  By putting in place a policy to start paying for the damage, we are ruining people's lives.  The UBI will be to help offset that, when your gas prices jump to $9.35 a gallon, and E5.50 per liter in Europe. 

\&gt;   Even if the companies made enough for the plan to be viable, what's the  incentive for a company in a capitalist country to do either of these  things at their own expense? 

Companies that do things in non-polluting ways will have massive price advantages.  The meat producer that pays the extra money to use methane-reducing feed will be saving much more by not polluting.  This type of thinking, in countless ways, will fund the efforts to reduce pollution all by itself.  We don't clean up because we aren't held accountable for being dirty.  Accountability makes being clean a reality.  And fossil fuels will end up being used for only the most valuable purposes.  

\&gt;  You've fixed the infection, but can never regain what was lost. A stitch in time saves 9. 

We've already lost an arm.  Government programs are slow and inefficient, as governments try really, really hard not to 'hurt jobs' or 'increase consumer costs'.  If we start accountability quicker, those same incentives that have helped bring billions out of poverty can be applied to pollution control.  Instead of losing another arm and a foot, we can limit loss to a hand and toes.

Also, we underestimate nature, which is really good at healing itself.

&gt; but Greta has never advocated starving, shutting off the electricity or a hard stop on all plastic use. I have not seen **anyone** seriously ask for any of that. 

*""We don't need to 'lower emissions'—our emissions have to stop,"" she  said, ""if we are to have chance to stay below the 1.5°C target"" set  forth in the Paris climate agreement.*

*""And until we have the technologies that at scale can put our  emissions to minus, then we must forget about 'net zero.' We need real  zero,"" Thunberg said.*

This is where I would say Thunberg is a naive teenager.  She doesn't realize what 'stopping emissions' means.","Global affairs, Economic systems, Living costs",ff7qfer,"OK this is actually a really intriguing argument, so I hope you'll forgive me for the wall of text.

&gt; We grant that pollution damages, then charge for pollution. Then, give it back to people as UBI, probably holding some back to pay for actual climate damage, like to relocate the Pacific islands that get wiped out as sea levels increase. 

Basically you're suggesting we acknowledge the serious harm being done, but allow that harm to continue because the 1 profit will go back to the people as UBI, and 2 go to repairing the harm done.

1 So there's companies polluting the environment, and you're suggesting that they have enough profit to both support a UBI **and** clean up the environment. Q1: Even if the companies made enough for the plan to be viable, what's the incentive for a company in a capitalist country to do either of these things at their own expense?

2 At best, cleanup removes pollution. It doesn't bring un-kill the wildlife, it doesn't reverse the pollution, pacific islands still end up underwater due to sea level rise, and millions of people who live along the coast still become refugees. It's like getting an infection and then amputating your arm. You've fixed the infection, but can never regain what was lost. A stitch in time saves 9.

&gt; Greta's message seems to be ""Stop if you love your children."" And she seems to have no clue that her message is ""Stop eating food if you love your children"" ""Stop using electricity if you love your children"" or ""Stop using plastics (that prevent disease and a variety of other uses) is you love your children"". 

I have to ask if you read the whole article or just the headline, because this is an oversimplification and exaggeration of both Tuesday's speech and Greta's overall position on the issue. She's generally directing her comments at politicians, and business leaders, advocating for societal and state level actions rather than individual actions. Climate activists do advocate for eating less meat, using renewable energy, and reducing one-use consumer plastics (like straws and bags,) but Greta has never advocated starving, shutting off the electricity or a hard stop on all plastic use.

In my mind, in a world with UBI, there will almost certainly be some people who simply want to do very little all day (I know a couple here in the UK). And hell, although I don't agree with that necessarily, I understand it, and they'll inevitably get up and do stuff when they're good and ready.

&gt; Giving every adult in the US a universal, guaranteed income of $10-$15k per year will yield very few positive benefits as it will provide a disincentive to work

*What work*? That's exactly the reason people are proposing UBI: because the demand for labour is dropping, and expected to drop further still. 

&gt; and influence large pockets of people who will simply live off of that amount, work as little as possible to support themselves

So what? I don't stay back at work for the hell of it; I do what I need to in order to earn my salary so I can pay the rent, then I go home to have a life. 

If there's no work that needs doing and people can get by without doing any, *what the fuck is wrong with that?*

&gt; and just sit around doing nothing of public value. 

Stifling my initial instinctive reaction, I'll suggest that *spending their money on goods and services* might be something you consider to be of 'public value'. 

&gt; In a more pessimistic view, it will encourage more crime, drug and alcohol abuse as it will remove structure and institutional discipline (i.e., going to work, being sober during daylight hours) from many adult's lives.

Oh, the moral panic. I'm sorry, you sound like a Salvation Army pamphlet from the 1880s bewailing the perils of fruitcake or something. Going to work is the means to an end, not an end in itself and of no particular value.

How is that a better society? Why the hell shouldn't he be at home doing something he wants to, instead of standing there getting sore feet? Who the hell are *you* to tell him what he should be doing?

&gt; UBI sends a message that would weaken the American values of industriousness and ambition

'Values' that are a complete and utter fucking lie for the vast majority of people stuck in minimum-wage jobs. No amount of ambition will turn people into entrepreneurs when they're stuck doing horrible underpaid menial labour. It takes all your energy, all your time, all your resources just to get by; there's no hope of buying out the company from working *really hard* stacking shelves. If you didn't go to school with the right people, if you didn't get a small loan of a million dollars, if you don't come from a wealthy background, you will never *become* wealthy. That's the stark reality for the vast, overwhelming majority of people. There's a tiny number of outliers, but they're very much the exception.

Calling people dissipated wastrels for not wanting to spend their lives chasing this non-existent opportunity... is very much like insulting them for not spending half their wages on lottery tickets. For a tiny few, it's life-changing, but for the rest, it's just sucking their life and resources away for no return. How *dare* you, honestly? 

&gt; and more people would conclude that it's OK to do nothing, we'll pay your expenses anyway.

...it's OK to do nothing, because there's nothing left to do. And since automation has slashed all those salaries from operating costs, there's *plenty* more margin to actually give something back. 

&gt; We already have an issue in this country with the % of employable adults in the work force at historical lows. (92 million last I checked, or 62.7%, the same as in 1977 vs. a peak of 67.3% in 2000). This would push even more people out of the workforce, potentially even bringing unemployment to zero or negative levels.

Um.  That sentence literally makes no sense. 

&gt; I have tried to be open minded, and consider reasoning such as ""it would give people time to learn new skills."" and ""it would provide a safety net,"" and I agree that that could happen, but the potential negatives far outweigh these bright spots.

*What* potential negatives? People drinking in the afternoon? 

If you're worried about hideous crime sprees from all these dissipated individuals making a pittance without needing to be chained to a counter somewhere, consider that the greatest driver of crime is poverty and stress. Give people a dependable source of income without the constant threat of losing it and the constant daily grind of having to get up at shit AM and work all day before going home exhausted, and that crime rate is going to drop through the fucking floor. 

&gt; The UBI would cost upwards of $3 trillion per year (assuming $10k/hr for 300mm citizens). Where does the money come to pay for this? It exceeds the amount taken in by the federal government in tax receipts.
Secondly, how is it fair to tax corporations who innovated and produced this automation to now subsidize the workers that that automation displaced. You create a disincentive to innovate and bring new automation to market, forestalling progress.

Okay. Think about this for a moment. 

Suppose Apple comes out tomorrow with its new iPerson, which can be trained to do anything a human can, needs no salary, no healthcare, no day off, works 24/7, requires no upkeep beyond keeping its battery charged, and it only costs $500. 

Every business owner in the country replaces their paid workers with iPeople, and rakes in massively higher profits because their outgoings drop to a few bucks a week in power bills. 

*What happens now*?

Now you've got 99% of the population on zero income because they're not working - and when their savings run out, your customer base dries up, and your business goes down the toilet along with the rest of the economy.

So if instead you take a big chunk of those extra profits, and pay them into a UBI, then people continue to have money, people continue to spend money, your business survives, everyone's business survives, people aren't starving in the street, the economy continues to function. 

Raise taxes in proportion to lost employment, and the money to pay for it all comes out of the savings on salaries. There's still an incentive to automate, just not a massive free-for-me. 

In this environment, people actually have a chance for ambition and industriousness to pay off, because they're not spending their whole lives scrabbling just to keep a roof over their head.

&gt;The economic left got sacrificed for the goals of identity groups, Sorry but if there was a debt, it's been re-payed.

I disagree. I don't blame the identity groups for this, as I said earlier I think neoliberalism (meaning unemployment, wage cuts, and brutal repression of radicals along with the carrot of consumerism and 'national security' in a heated Cold War, and later ""global war on terror"" context) weakened the left as a whole. The tokenism used to appease identity groups is in my opinion little different to the tokenism of consumerism and meagre wage increases (and probably soon UBI) that appeases the proletariat. 

I like you believe that minorities and marginalised groups would benefit from socialism and this necessitates anti capitalist struggle, my difference is I think your dismissal of identity groups (which are not liberal idealist categories, they stem from material socio-economic relations - why stick with a class binary when this has only historically alienated and neglected marginal peoples?) as inherently liberal is repeating the mistakes of the last century. In a revolutionary situation indentity groups could definitely cooperate successfully with marxist-leninists, granted the latter be willing to listen to the (real!) concerns and grievances of those groups. Historically these grievances have been not just regarding socio-economic conditions, but also the marginalisation of women and minorities within marxist-leninist parties. I don't have good knowledge of communist parties in the US, but in Europe they've also had a bad record of supporting imperialism (presumably to appeal to chauvinist workers) which alienated immigrants.

I live in Montreal where there are many advantages, national health care, social assistance that is cash money deposited into your bank account every month, Employment assurance &amp; parental leave covering newborns &amp; those that need to care for elderly parents. Government run auto liability insurance that guarantees that you will be taken care of in the event of a accident, workmen's compensation to cover misshapes on the job, no lawyers need to collect benefits.  Old age government pensions that are pretty much self financing, Low cost education &amp; job retraining, seven dollar a day subsidized daycare, and the list of services that the government does to facilitate one's life are many more &amp; expanding. 

The basic difference where I live is that elected officials don't need huge sums of money &amp; mega donors to get elected &amp; understand that they work for the population &amp; not the corporations. They are held accountable to a higher standard, they are basically hired to manage &amp; improve our lives everyday. Our country will most likely have some form of UBI within the next 15 to 20 years at most, we are currently experimenting with it in many different forms. Although we pay a larger percentage in taxes we get to see it in our daily lives.

644,"&gt; When you say society will fall, what do you mean? Less government tax revenue? Lower birthrate? You can have a peaceful society with lower government revenue if business spending takes over, and a society with lower birthrate can result in less crowding and pressure on the environment.

Lower birthrates mean less tax revenue in the future as well as less business spending because there are less people employed, and less people paying into the government to support the increasingly aging population above them.  Yes, you can have a ""peaceful society"", but it's still a society in decline, and not the Western Society we once new.  Japan is a great example of this.  It's peaceful, but it's dying.  And there's no mass immigration due to their xenophobic ways (and justifiably so) to displace the decline unlike Europe with it's African/Middle Eastern immigration and the US with it's Latin immigration, that both parties love to exploit for their own benefit.

Whether or not technology automation will alleviate that remains to be seen, however government subsidizing of a increasingly under-employed/unemployed population requires money to come from somewhere, and if this requires increased spending from businesses, you can bet your ass they will exert more political influence BECAUSE of the money they're investing, further divorcing the Western world from Democracy/Republics into Corporatocracies or Oligarchies.

Mass immigration from 3rd world countries brings 3rd world poverty into Western Society, further requiring the governments to subsidize an ever increasing poor under-educated population with fewer and fewer people able to pay into the system to support such an absorption in the first place.  Another downward spiral.

Furthermore, by eliminating the middle class that is able to absorb the ups and downs of the economy, you're now relying on a few at the top to subsidize everyone down below.  When the Economy goes into a downturn, and it will eventually, those select few may go belly up, which then puts immense pressure on everyone down below, to the tune of riots and food lines, and the ones at the top that have survived, if they do, will gobble up those around them and further solidify their control (JP Morgan Chase comes to mind).  

And as for automation, you can find studies that say it'll displace anywhere from 6% to 80% of our jobs in the near future.  Even at 2/3's or 66% of our jobs which I've seen recently mentioned, the Great Depression was a 25% unemployment rate.

&gt; Many liberal democracies have successfully integrated Abrahamic religions into society well and moderated it, e.g. Australia, USA, Malaysia, Indonesia. 

Islamic societies within foreign nations HAVE NOT integrated well.  When you have a slow trickle of immigration, they are forced to integrate into the existing population.  When you have a mass movement/migration, they form their own enclave, and while populations have done that in the past, Islam has had more radical tendencies that deter them from integrating than Christians within the recent past (We're not talking Puritanical birth of the 13 colonies here).  And since they don't integrate well, you have the people that migrated giving birth to children who ALSO don't integrate well, and then feel alienated from the general population and begin to identify with their home countries, and when they see the ""injustices"" of what's happening to their home countries while NOT identifying with the country they're currently living in, an Islamic Radical terrorist is created.

And for you to site ""Liberal Democracies"" and a country like Indonesia or Malaysia in the same sentence is ridiculous.  The fact that you can be jailed or killed for even saying you're an unbeliever or godless or atheist COMPLETELY NEGATES / REFUTES the definition of ""liberal democracy"".  

THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN ANY OFFICIALLY ISLAMIC COUNTRY, so long as they're jailing/killing non-believers.  PERIOD.  The US Constitution holds no religion above any other, though Christians Conservatives will try to tell you differently.  I'm willing to bet there's absolutely NO SEPARATION of Church and State in the aforementioned countries and whatever constitutions they have, deeming Islam as the official religion and rule of law.  

Having mass migrations from such countries as well as the Middle East/Africa assures the destruction of current, true, genuine Liberal Democracies, the Western World AS we, the people who currently live in it, know it.

&gt; A universal basic income is what many have suggestion should the robots take over all jobs.

This is a pipe dream in the near future, such like single payer healthcare.  For instance, California in the US is attempting to push ahead in the ""Healthcare for all"" realm ala Bernie Sanders and wants to implement a Single Payer system.  However, they have calculated the costs and it will be $400 billion annually at the least, which is more than it's annual budget.  Couple that with the fact that 2/3rd's of its population is already on subsidized Medicaid Healthcare, so where would the tax revenue come from when the top and middle are already being squeezed to support an increasingly poor illegal immigrant population, that will also be under this ""single payer system""?

Now translate this to the greater US as a whole.  The costs are unreal, but don't let that stop head in the cloud liberals from saying it's possible, a long with no hunger, no wars, open borders, no hate, for all.  Fantasies and Fiction are great.

If you have neither than people are gonna have to take whatever job they can just to not starve to death. If companies know that they can give however low a wage they want then they will, and they'll carry on funnelling money away from the majority of the population to the wealthy few. 

The issue is that a large portion of employers have little incentive to hire the best workers they can, instead just hiring the cheapest is usually best (basically every job that pays at or near minimum wage). This means that employers often don't need to reward their worker's effort or skill in the form of a higher wage, so instead just pay the absolute minimum.

The reason why it has a low sample size is because it is an experiment with limited funding and was intended to only go to those under a certain income level. As well, full results have not been published because it hasn't actually finished yet, which is why I made sure to provide one that specifically cited the researches:

&gt; As SEED heads towards its July conclusion (Tubbs hopes to extend it), researchers evaluating the program are finding that most spend their $500 on the mundane things usually just out of reach: transportation, utilities, healthcare, debt. Nearly 40 percent of tracked spending went to food. One participant bought dentures. Another cooked her son a birthday crab boil and bought him new jeans.

When they finish, they will likely publish the full results [here](https://www.stocktondemonstration.org/). Hopefully, since it has inspired the creation of [a coalition of mayors who will now be testing UBI](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/coalition-of-11-us-mayors-pledges-to-support-universal-basic-income/), we will see more results in the next several years.

As for the second, the reason I cited the article as well as the study is because it makes it easier to understand what was being tested if a person isn't able to fully understand the jargon in the study. 

&gt; Kueng divided them into five groups based on income, with the richest group earning an average of $104,000 per person annually and the poorest an average of $16,000. The wealthiest households spent an average of 61% of the check in the first quarter after receiving it, while those at the bottom of the economic ladder spent only 12%.
&gt; 
&gt; At first, Kueng was surprised. But upon further reflection, he realized that households were exhibiting “near-rationality.” People may act slightly irrationally—for instance, spending a windfall all at once instead of saving it—if the consequences are not severe. “They only make mistakes if it doesn’t matter much for them,” he says. In this case, the rich might treat the dividend check like fun money that they spend frivolously once a year.

Basically, people who are well off treat the APFD check as a bonus and spend more of it all at once when they get it, while those who are lower in income will spend less and tend to save it to incorporate as part of their yearly income. 

In other words, low income individuals tend to be very responsible with how they spend extra money that isn't part of their normal work income. If you are interested, there are other studies that do examine how people spend money they receive from cash transfers. [This one happens to be good for showing that people are also less likely to spend the money on what it defines as ""temptation goods.""](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/617631468001808739/pdf/WPS6886.pdf)

&gt; There definitely needs to be a lot more work done and it seems like none of the sources describe the effect on the market which is most people's biggest concern.

As for this, there actually is research which addresses it as well. [Overall, multiple studies have shown that there is pretty much no effect on inflation rates.](https://ubi.earth/basic-income-doesnt-cause-inflation) As well, [the Roosevelt Institute determined that, at worst, a UBI doesn't hurt the economy, but at best it can provide substantial benefits.](https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Modeling-the-Macroeconomic-Effects-of-a-Universal-Basic-Income.pdf) You would be amazed at just how much research on UBI there is out there. From everything I have read, the question isn't really about whether or not it will cause any harm, but rather about whether or not we can find a way to get it implemented. Some forms could certainly cause harm if they are poor models, such as by replacing all welfare with flat $250/month checks since many would lose significant amounts of income. However, assuming a model isn't just completely unreasonable like that, it seems UBI is a significantly beneficial policy.

Edit: Also, if you are interested, there is an anthology which contains over 70 different scholarly articles on UBI. Below is a link to a Google Scholar search which will provide you with a download link. Just click the link that has [Book] with a PDF from academia.edu. It should be the first result.

Although not mentioned in the linked article, it was tracked.

Transfer Patterns 

Over the year, approximately 40% of the money loaded to the prepaid debit card was either transferred to a pre-existing bank account or withdrawn as cash. Analysis of narrative data indicates that these patterns are attributable to rational financial behavior. The way people moved money off of the card reflected their prior experiences in the market and prior strategies for avoiding risk while managing household needs. Participants described four reasons for transferring the money off of the debit card. First, some preferred relying on existing relationships with financial institutions that they already utilized for household budgeting and paying bills. This prompted some to transfer a portion of the money to their primary account, allowing them to manage all income in a single place. Second, others exchanged the $500 for cash, allowing them to pay rent, divide commonly held bills among family members, or for covering other bills to local payees that do not accept electronic payments. Third, a pervasive lack of trust in financial services in the community and prior experience with predatory actors motivated some to quickly remove money from the card. Stockton, like many racially and ethnically diverse communities, has a concentration of predatory financial services, like payday lenders, embedded in non-white and lower income neighborhoods (Mapping Financial Opportunity, 2020). The community experience of ongoing wealth extraction, both through those services as well as the foreclosure crisis, have rightly primed the community to be wary of any financial services; and, while SEED was created in coordination with community members, and widely publicized by the Mayor’s Office, many recipients still worried the program was a scam. Finally, prior to SEED’s launch, Ontario’s basic income program was cancelled two years early and covered extensively by the press (Frazee, 2018). Recipients feared that if Ontario could end abruptly, then SEED might follow suit.

It won't be ""out of money,"" although the exhaustion of the surplus may result in smaller SS payments to recipients going forward, since there won't be a trust fund to make up the difference between revenues received and promised benefits.

Technically true, but the problem is that a large part of the current federal debt is borrowed against the SS trust fund, and your projection assumes the US government will actually pay the trust fund back. I don't believe they will, I think they will go insolvent sometime in the 2040's and SS will evaporate along with most Americans private retirement funds (which are also invested in US debt - US treasury bonds).

Absolutely. This whole notion that if you are against welfare it means you hate poor people, is ridiculous. Welfare used to be more personal and manual. It was given to people by a combination of church groups, brotherhoods, community groups, family members, friends, charities, and government. This meant that people had to ask for welfare and demonstrate how they were going to use it. A church might give you food and a bed, a brotherhood (up a third of all families were a part of a brotherhood in the 1930's) might give you money to help set you up for an interview, neighbours and friends might pitch in because they know you are a good, hard-working person and are facing poor luck, family really wants you to succeed, charities are usually specific to certain needs and are set up to efficiently help people with those needs, and government would be a final backstop to supplement all those other charitable groups.

Now welfare is very impersonal. You no longer have to be recognized of any virtue or ethic in order to receive it. You are entitled to it and can easily claim it just because you don't want to work.

Im fairly center in most things, however a marginal tax system, where the rich( huge corporate conglomerates) pay a higher rate with less loopholes is the only way to keep a healthy budget. 

Realistically, I support Andrew Yang because eventually UBI and his vat tax will end up saving us money, not initially but long term. By trimming down bureaucracy and overreaching social safety nets. Also he supports swapping income tax rates and capital gains rates.

I also want a conservative to oversee restructuring SSI because I believe it needs to be in order to regain solvency ( also an increase rate for people to choose, especially with UBI coming into play, like a choose your rate kind of deal ) i dont think it needs privatized.

Also, student loans NEEDS to be addressed, the social democrats are right about that. The conservatives are also correct in saying we need a law to tell publically funded universities to bring Administrative costs and total costs down or we dont send them any money.

Basically, our programs in America need reworked. We have to cut useless military spending, use UBI to rein in bureaucracy, and pay more taxes overall.

4,"This is pretty easy to unpack.

The monetary value of these jobs is driven by two main factors.

The first is economics.  Supply and demand.  Let's take the words 'Front-Line' and replace them with the word 'Unskilled'.  The supply of unskilled labor is highest, so the economic value is lowest.

The second is value of life.  What value do we place on the well being of human beings?  In Canada, we place a VERY high value there, comparitively to other nations.  The reasons are deeper and more complex than I'll give you in a Reddit post, but the evidence we place a high value on life is evidenced by our high minimum wage, universal health care, and other social programs.

Should we place more value on life?  Maybe.  How do we do it?  Raise minimum wage further.  Tax more and redistribute income.  Nationalize industries so we can funnel the money in to social programs, rather than billionaires pockets.. this last part is how you find UBI.

When we have UBI, suddenly companies are forced to compete for labor, because if you pay shit for dangerous work, people suddenly have the power to stop showing up.  They're not dependent on that paycheque anymore.  This is what it looks like to value human life.

The biggest risk to this model is that we become an entirely uncompetitive nation of Gopnik.  Google Gopnik, watch the first video.  I'm 100% in favor of UBI, if someone can solve the Gopnik problem.","- Economic systems

They would get a value depending of the need based on the family budget of each country, 800 is too high for most of places. For example just $200 would immediately reduce poorness to a minimum and extreme poorness to almost zero in a country like India or Peru.

&gt;Printing more money creates more inflation. And having more purchasing  power means people can buy more stuff. Like that new iPhone or 4K TV.  Which results in more waste. Which would hurt the real economy, our ecology. 

Yes and no, first of all you are not printing more money UBI must be paid with higher class's taxes. A buff in purchasing power increase inflation on the short term but reduces it on the long term as the debts of people are reduced with a constant income, China is good example of this. Also luxury things like an iPhone would change much at the beginning since the value is not enough for that; one iphone equals to several salaries normally people have to save money for a year to buy it, but yes again China exploded on consumerism after the middle class grew, but that is another topic, environment.

Universal basic income would simply patch the problem, it's not a solution for the root cause of the problem. We should keep the momentum of automation going by using the UBI money to move forward and create a sustainable infrastructure.

If I understand it correctly, people would get about 800 euros/dollars per month, regardless of income. That in effect would also disturb the market. Because in cities where the average income is higher, prices also rise. A sandwich in the city center of Amsterdam is 5 euros. 30km south it's 1 euro. Adding 800 euros to everyone's wallets may increase prices as well. Because why not? You can no ask more money, because most people have more money. Then you're back at square one.

And of course, printing more money creates more inflation. And having more purchasing power means people can buy more stuff. Like that new iPhone or 4K TV. Which results in more waste. Which would hurt the real economy, our ecology. So again, no problem is solved.

People on food stamps or who need housing vouchers, or disabled people who are only allowed to have $2K in their bank account at any time to continue receiving disability (this is its own problem, but that’s a different topic) would be either booted out of their programs or forced to use the UBI payments and decrease the rest of their monthly income.

From what I remember, his campaign said that people could keep their housing vouchers. But I believe you are right that the disability and SNAP programs would not stack up. The idea was that those in poverty and the legally disabled could choose to take the $1000/month UBI with no strings attached or keep the programs that they were already on. He claimed that his UBI was a better deal because it would be unconditional, give out more than what people were currently receiving, and would allow those people to find a job and make money without worrying about meeting welfare standards.

In effect, this would mean UBI would benefit everyone except people who are poor enough to need social services— everyone else gets $1K/month, but people who qualify for disability or food stamps or housing assistance need to either decrease their monthly income by that $1K to keep getting services, or use the $1K for those basic needs, which, especially for people on disability with care and housing needs, or people who qualify for housing, medicare, and food assistance, it just realistically won’t cover.

That article fails to acknowledge that inflation is not merely caused by an increase of money supply (quantitative inflation), although this phenomenon is accepted to be the major role-player in long term inflation.

Short and medium term inflation is usually described under the umbrella of qualitative inflation, which is typically discussed in the context of fluctuations in wages and prices. An increase in demand for goods and services (cuz people have more money to spend) as well as a decline in demand for money itself (because everyone has an extra source of income) are both factors in short and medium term inflation, as these things will directly result in an increase in prices under a supply/demand curve model, i.e. reducing the value of each dollar relative to the goods or services provided (inflation).

Again, I'm not talking about the hyperinflation booogeymen, just a natural phenomenon that we should anticipate if there's going to be a surge in consumer spending in absence of an immediate increase in GDP.

59,"It should, for the most part. I’m sure some companies would like to keep certain market shares, and in cases of a near monopoly on the market they could easily pass more onto the consumer. Confused by your second question, you may be above my knowledge base on this, I’m a math grad with a minor in risk management so I just learned about the “who really pay a tax” thing in a lot of my finance courses.  


The article linked above about the 55% thing is using an aggregate of different commodity markets, hair dressers were one they used and sit down restaurants in France. I don’t know the domination of chains in France, but I’ll assume it’s similar to the US, as well as hairdressers being more or less an upper middle to upper class commodity. Those people are probably going to continue to get their hair done regardless, and that’s  supplanted with the evidence of them paying 79% of the VAT.  

And, it’s kind of further evidenced by [studies](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-would-bear-burden-vat) that suggest when you supplement a VAT that exempts core essentials from the tax (food, medicine, healthcare) with cash payments, like UBI, you get lower inflation for the bottom 20% than you do the top 1%:

&gt; better approach is to provide a limited cash payment—that is, a demogrant or a refundable tax credit. That way, everyone receives the same benefit, in dollars, which translates into a larger share of low-income households’ income.

&gt; In the same study, Toder, Nunns, and Rosenberg simulate the effects of a 7.7 percent broad-based VAT with a refundable tax credit (the higher tax rate keeps the net revenues the same as the 5 percent, broad-based VAT with no tax credit). They find that the VAT in combination with the tax credit would impose an average tax burden of 0.6 percent on households in the bottom quintile of the income distribution. Households in the top 1 percent of the income distribution would face an average tax burden of 3.6 percent. Their results also show that the distribution of a narrow-based VAT that excludes spending on food, housing, and health care is much the same as the distribution of a broad-based tax (table 1).  


Admittedly, if it’s a flat VAT on everything then the poor will be disadvantaged more, but, according to Yang’s website:

&gt; This VAT would vary based on the good to which it’s applied, with staples having a lower rate or being excluded, and luxury goods having a higher rate.

He’s trying to only focus on low elasticity of demand products (ie customers who might complain about an increase but are still gonna buy it) and hit luxury goods. So while averages in other places is important, it’s also the type of consumer being modeled in that aggregate. They are people who can afford sit down restraints, hair dressers, and other goods that the bottom 20% of the country can’t afford, and won’t be seeing much of an increase in a limited, narrow VAT in conjunction with UBI.

**edit:** hope I get this in before you respond. I notice you claim that people who get more than 1K in benefits will be hurt regardless, but the study I’ve linked implies it will be a less than 1% increase in tax burden. It’s not nothing, but it’s definitely not a lot.","Taxonomy: Taxes, Data analysis and research.",eooa804,"Your elasticity arguments should hold whether inflation is VAT-driven or not, right?

63,"&gt;[Alderman] Pawar has convinced the majority of Chicago lawmakers to co-sponsor the plan, and he is hoping that the Chicago City Council will soon work with the mayor to implement it.

&gt;UBI-style direct cash transfers have been implemented elsewhere. And they work.

&gt;One of the most effective anti-poverty programs in the 21st century is Brazil’s Programa Bolsa Familia. Deborah Wetzel, a senior staffer at the World Bank, called the program a “quiet revolution,” noting that PBF “has been key to help Brazil more than halve its extreme poverty — from 9.7 to 4.3 percent of the population.” Moreover, the program also helped to shrink income inequality by about 15 percent, says Wetzel. One study by the Inter-American Development Bank noted that the program cost about 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product of Brazil, but was credited with reducing the infant mortality rate caused by undernourishment and diarrhea by more than 50 percent.

&gt;PBF is not a universal program, as payments go only to Brazilians living below a certain wage threshold. (In 2013, about one quarter of Brazilians received this benefit). Another key difference is that unlike PBF, which requires that children of recipient families attend school and regularly visit the doctor, UBI is unconditional. But PBF is a useful model for UBI, as both are direct cash transfer programs.

&gt;If Pawar’s program is implemented by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Chicago would be the largest city in America to experiment with UBI. Matt Bruenig, the founder of the People’s Policy Project and a UBI advocate, is skeptical that a municipality can run a successful UBI because cities tend to have limited capacity to collect revenue. However, he does think that the pilot project has merit.

&gt;“This looks like a UBI pilot program, which is a good idea, just to study its effects and produce data that can help guide other UBI efforts,” he told The Intercept.

&gt;“Our hope, that I know will be born out in this pilot, is that it will show that when we smooth out the EITC, and we provide a monthly basic income to 1,000 families, that they will be able to plan for expenses, they can make decisions about savings, they can make decisions about investing, they could make decisions about how they could deal with a financial emergency, just like all families do,” Pawar told us. “And once implemented, we’ll be able to hopefully scale it.”

76,"I guess some ideas for the aristocratic person (so I’m somewhat answering the actual question now) would be:

- A separation of government so that people in a society should have way more direct control over moral-based decisions. All human-rights laws that are not heavily tied to economics could be made completely seperate to government, with seperate democratic representatives to the MPs that decide economic decisions and whatever else. And this branch of democracy would be above the current government, and be able to hold it fully accountable, and also state the laws of the land in regards to what democracy is with the public having a lot of direct control over what laws it makes. The case of covid passports and lockdowns and such wouldn't fall under this branch though as they are too linked to the economy, and some other controversial topics wouldn't either such as immigration policy. But things like equal rights, abortion policy, euthanasia, family law, justice punishement - should all fall under this branch and be seperate from our governement that deals with the economics of the country.

- A huge improvement in world-wide infrastructure. How amazing it would be to have hyper-loop lines leading to most places including connecting all continents so you could get from A to B in so little time, with ease and at not much cost. The amount of economic stimulus from such infrastructure would be incredible as well as the benefits to society of being able to visit so many distant lands. I would propose that the lines would ideally run underground so they are free from environment damage such as storms and terrorism. They could also then be made in the most efficient network layout possible without having issues of going through people’s land, destroying the environment and using up land that should ideally be able to be used for the living rather than transport.

- Complete freedom of movement. If there wasn’t so much economic disparity then a world without borders would be amazing.

- Limit the influence of religion. As I view religion as a huge negative to the world, that causes animosity and wars. There will never be anything near peace with religions having so much control. Ideally this could be done through economic limitations.

- Disable all nuclear weapons as they pose far too big a threat.

- Have people get to Mars and start work on terraforming Mars and or Venus.

- Rapid adoption of electric and autonomous vehicles for last mile solutions.

- All laws for all countries to be written in a set logical format, hopefully using a programming language on something like github. So all laws would be easily accessible to the public, would be fixed, would be more easily read by AI, and people would be able to more easily suggest changes that should be made to laws to improve them or fix loop-holes.

- A single world-currency. Hopefully a crypto-currency that is very stable but gains from it (in the form of stable inflation) would all go to public use.

- A universal basic income so people could be free from having to work. Automate as much as possible. Then a removal of the minimum wage so companies could charge what they wished for labour and it would be up to potential workers whether they wanted to work for that extra cash or just be happy living off the basic income and lifestyle it was able to provide.

- Shorten copyright and patent length to like 10 years or something (probably variable depending on the particular industry). So people couldn’t benefit from them for far too many years and prevent competition from arising. They are useful for stimulating invention but a hindrance when they’re used for too long to stifle competition. Copyright hourds works of art for far too long when companies and people have already long made the majority of the money that they’re going to make from them and now society is just losing out from those pieces of art not being free.

- Make it so nobody owns lands or buildings and they remain public 
property. Everyone rents their home and business properties from the aristocracy but they are free to change that property how they wish whilst renting it. If they add value to the property or land then they can gain from this via retribution of wealth when they leave the tenancy and someone else moves in at a higher rent value than they would have without the changes that were made. This will prevent house prices from rising out of control, allow everyone to have a house they are able to make changes to and benefit from unlike today where renters are unable to do that, will prevent wealth staying in a family forever being passed down from generation to generation and will keep the immense value of land and property in use as public money rather than it being used to syphon money from the poor to the rich and from public government taxes to private entities through the benefits / UBI system.

- Have an official online system for identity. So people can actually identify who they are online. Also have important information kept securely in such a system such as a person’s grades they received, their work and evaluation history, and criminal prosecutions. So this sort of thing cannot be lied about or faked.

- Set up a system so goods that are considered unhealthy or addictive have to be purchased via a separate personal bank account. So anything sold in stores such as cigarettes, alcohol, unhealthy food, gambling, pornography they can only be purchased via an ‘adult card’ in a special personal bank account that people have to use. It would be mandatory for all shops to flag these items differently to other products and only allow them to be purchased with that card. Everyone should remain having the exact same freedom to buy what they want if they want to do so. But having such a system in place could benefit people by making it harder for children to purchase these things, making it easier for people to monitor how much you’re spending on these things and give rise to the possibility of self-opting in to restrict the amount of cash-flow you’re able to spend on these unhealthy things.

Basically what I wanted to get at is whether people would actually want to use this power and if so how would they use it. Or would they consider it 'morally wrong' to basically be a dictator in charge of the world; even if they had very good intentions and considered themselves someone who would immensely improve the world and the average standard of life for humanity.

I wanted to pose this question because I thought about the actual real possibility of this happening in real-life at some time in the future. If when super-intelligent ai is created it seems feasible that one sole person would be able to have control over it, and they would then use the power of such advanced knowledge given to them by this AI to gain control and stop anyone else from ever creating such an AI out of risk that someone else would use it against them and gain control for themselves.

I imagined that given the current state of the world this power would fall into the hands of a military, political or company head from either Chinese or the USA and if this technology seemed on the horizon then both sides would be scrambling to achieve it first out of fear what the other side would do with such a power.

I then wondered how such a person would use the AI:

- Would they shape the world to maximize personal gain?
- Would they do like most previous dictators and try to enslave everyone?
- Would they consider life a bad and negative thing and make the human race extinct?
- Would they force their own world-view, beliefs or morality onto the human race?
- Would they try to maximize people’s freedoms and provide people with the best life based on recommendations from within their own opinions, society’s opinions or the advanced calculations from the AI on what would be best to maximise life experience for people?
- Or would they consider it too much power and responsibility for a single person to have and try to leave life going on ‘as normal and natural as possible’ whilst still preventing anyone else from creating and gaining the power from super-intelligent life. The question then would still be to what extent and in what method they would release any new innovations that the AI came up with. Because if they didn’t ever release any of this information then humanity would be losing out on an incredible amount of innovation such as new cures for diseases and a million other things.

I did then query how I would personally use such an AI if it fell into my lap. I didn’t come up with an answer though, I didn’t exactly want to force myself to come up with an answer because it would be so hard.

I often consider what things could be done to improve the world and how I would go about them. I’m sure I would be able to make an incredibly positive impact on the world with such power.

However the thought of actually forcing my world-views upon the world; the amount of responsibility that would entail, the sheer amount of people you would inevitably hurt, inadvertently kill or have their life completely changed for better or worse from your actions - that’s something of a rather big head fuck.

Even if you have the best intentions for the world and improve it ‘on average’ for people there will still unintentionally be many, many people caught negatively in the cross-fire as a consequence of your actions and you will be drastically altering the course of humanity forever.

You would also have to contend with the notion that life in itself is a purely negative thing. A number of nihilistics posit that it would be better just to simply wipe humanity or even all life off the face on the planet and that would be the best thing to do as it would remove all the suffering that everyone has to endure and there would no longer be any pain of suffering. If you had that power to make us extinct and did not use it to do so I imagine some people would suggest that you’re the worst person to ever exist because your inaction will have allowed an unimaginable amount of pain and suffering in the world to keep on churning and existing when you had the ability to stop it all.

Whatever someone was to decide, you will likely become the most important and influential person to ever exist. It’s also possible that with the knowledge gained from the AI that you would have the technology to make yourself live for a lot longer a period of time or even indefinitely and with that would also come the head fuck of whether to release that ability to the general public if there was going to negative consequences of over-population that occurred by doing so and then if you don’t would it still be morally right to use it on just yourself given how important it would be for you to continue to stay in power and help the world become a better place?

The amount of questions of morality like this that you would face would be impossibly difficult to come to terms with but at the same time if you don’t then humanity could be losing out on incredible gains that would help billions of people. And it’s not like these questions could be handed off to the AI to answer because the AI would not have a basis of morality, if it did such morality would have been programmed into it by some person or group of people with their own biased views of morality.

So what would I do if you forced me to answer? I still have no idea. I know something I would do which is to overthink it and have the worst case of overchoice paralyze the world has ever seen. I am a nihilist but I still have a personal ‘moral code’, even if I know such a moral code is an irrelevant evolved construct via evolutionary selection - it’s still a code that I live by and as such to be put in such a position would be a moral dilemma I would struggle to solve.

Stepping back and viewing it purely from a nihilistic view would not be any help at all. Because from a purely nihilistic view it would say to me that it’s irrelevant what I choose to do. It’s irrelevant whether I use the power gained from the AI or not. It’s irrelevant if someone used such a power to kill everyone on the planet or make the world an incredibly amazing place for most people to live in. I have to say that it would be more than tempting just to step into this nihilistic realization and take away all the personal responsibility I have due to everything being irrelevant anyway. But you’re still left with the choice then of what you would do? Which I have still not answered because I really don’t know.

Imagine something potentially even worse: if you’re put into that position but with a short time-limit to consider it and if you don’t use it you lose it and someone else would get to use it after you who you know would enforce a horrible world-view on humanity with disastrous consequences all because you were unable to overcome your choice paralysis. The anxiety in that situation would be unbearable for me.

I’ve probably almost written the outline for the idea of a novel there 😂 If you want to steal any of my thoughts feel free to do so and then just throw some money my way when you sell the rights to it to Hollywood for a fortune 💰

Except I guess I still haven't given you any answer or help with what the protagonist will end up doing, which is the question you actually asked? My advise: leave it open-ended for the audience to decide, that's the easiest thing to do when you can't think of a good answer and people will call it artistic or some crap 😂

EDIT:
Oh! Or imagine there being 2 or even 3 people in the room and they all have to agree on an answer otherwise this twat would get to use the AI and enslave the world. And these people have different viewpoints and struggle to come up with an answer they can agree on but they know they have to somehow in order to stop this other twat using it. You could have one person as like a nihilist who doesn't believe in morality, one person that is a considered nice and wants to help people but fundamentally thinks life is horrible and wants to end it for everyone to stop all the suffering and then another person who has a load of ideas on how to make the world a better place like having a new aristocratic government run using the knowledge of this ai. That way you could set out this part of the novel as a philosophical debate amongst those people.",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ohh boy. There's really no point talking to you is there. It's like reading some fever dream, scribble, on a Gordon Gekko fanboy page. 

People get these by fighting.  Through more regulation and more protections.

&gt;TAXES DO NOT GIVE, they TAKE,

Wrong. More taxes on the wealthy and corporations, equals more public spending, more redistribution of wealth, and less out of pocket spending for the average joe for services (for example healthcare). Look at the disaster that is  privatization. Might take away a few yachts though. You got me there.  And less deposits for Panamanian banks.  

&gt;Ok lets have an example: you live in a town with 5k people and no public transport,...

Public transit and other PUBLIC services are run more efficiently by the government; for the people, by the people. (I have actually worked on assessments and studies that have shown this).  And should not ever be run as for profit businesses. They are services that benefit societies more than just monetarily.  If companies would like the privilege of doing business and earning money, in a place with an educated work force (with money to blow), good electrical, sewage, disposal, water....  Then they need to pay up. 
Public means for the public.  You, me.  Do you see how you give up your own power and freedom so corporations can profit off you. You have a slave mentality. 
It's sad that people simp so hard for that corporate cock. Maybe you like that boot on your neck serf.  
The government is you; it is your/our money; why do you think they are called public servants.

What? Ever since the industrial revolution the economy has exploded and means of production as well as purchasing power have reached the hands of more people, more than ever, what are you on abaout, the environment has nothing to do with it, if anything we have exploited it and just NOW are we starting to realize and suffer its long term consequences.

However its a constant change, MB for example will be fully renewable and self sustainable by 2022 (supposedly, steps in the right direction).

&gt;You know why nations like Canada, western Europe and the US are the wealthy, developed, first world nations they are

Because of strong industries and production surpluses idiot, taxes and regulations have nothing to do with it and are actually hindering the earnings they make. The USA's healthcare system is brutally expensive yet its the best one out there (ohhh maybe more money motivates people to work harder and better) and people have the option to take insurance that covers for such expenses.

&gt;When persons are not in despair and destitute, they have free time and spare cash, they spend it

you are just making it easier for me, TAXES DO NOT GIVE, they TAKE, what gives to the people is the work they perform

&gt;No regulation and taxes has the wealth hoarded with 1% of the population and the economy stagnates and so does innovation and new business. It creates monopolies which stifles a free and open economy.

Ok lets have an example: you live in a town with 5k people and no public transport, you want to make a transportation company that takes people from Stupidtown to Idiotville, what would make it easier for you? If you could freely do it and invest in the project, while staying in line with your community's city hall rules, you do your earning calculations and ROI study, so you can finally solve the problem and make a functioning service; or if you had to request a permission to the central government which takes 50% of your earnings and makes it totally not worth it for you and yall stay without a means of getting from Stupidtown to Idiotville?

Where in that whole story did Taxes an regulation help with ANYTHING?

&gt;Monopolies

Monopolies exist when a government allows only ONE group to do a certain economic activity. Without regulations, if A company fucks up, company B C and D come to take their place and do it better, thats called market appropiation and its what brings the best conditions to the end customer, quality and price-wise. Monopolies ARE created by regulation.

&gt;After ww2 taxes in Canada and the US were higher on the wealthy and corporations and more and more regulation was introduced and this lead to the greatest economic growth period ever. Now what do we have? De-regulation. Privitization. Austerity, while dip shit billionaires build rocket ships to fly around in.

What? The greatest economic periods were the Industrial revolution, the 2k internet boom, the post war rise of Marshall's plan ""clients"", taxes only took out gains from those bubbles, never aided them in any way.

No, middle class currently isn't getting any social welfare because they are not qualified for most programs. Almost all social welfare programs are geared towards the poor and unemployed.

You can't cut incarceration and healthcare in exchange for 1500 a month. It'd be a net loss for people that benefits (not prisoners, obviously) from the programs.

1500 a month won't counterbalance a $65,000.00 operation for someone that actually needs the UBI to live. And Socializing healthcare is another mess entirely, especially in the U.S.

VAT is one of the worst system in the world. Coming from where there's a 14.975% sales and VAT.

You could double the welfare state, giving more money for those that actually need it and save money on the brand new administration that'd be needed to manage UBI (which would raise the cost even higher).

&gt;We would save $100 – 200+ billion as people would be able to take better care of themselves and avoid the emergency room, jail, and the street and would generally be more functional. 

That's a big if. You can't base budgeting on hypothetical scenarios extrapolated from extremely limited tests that have been cut short in most cases.

A VAT on top of current taxes would considerably damage GDP in the U.S.

I would be for replacing income tax entirely with a VAT+Sales tax, tho. As it targets spending instead of income and would encourage savings.

Putting all those new taxes would absolutely deflate and distort the economy more than it would potentially boost it by having people spend money they didn't produce themselves.

And those taxes are all only punishment on the successful, which is why it has depressionary effects on work and investments.

The current welfare state is better at targeting the needs of those that use it and managing money than UBI, even despite all its flaws.

A negative tax system (which a much larger proportion of economists support) would be a better system implemented with a caveat that anyone benefiting from it would need to submit proof they are actively looking for a job or can't work due to a condition, with random audits and extreme fines and permanent ban from the program for people that fraud.

The best system would be no income tax, a VAT of 30-35% excluding first necessity products, capital and dividend taxes, and a negative tax system that follows inflation. That way you can't hide revenue inside corporations, revenue actively reinvested into the economy is encouraged, and revenue that is actively going towards discretionary spending is taxed.

115,"&gt; Money is debt in two ways: 1. It's an IOU for higher money in the hierarchy. 2. It's an IOU for goods and services from the economy, backstopped by institutions.

The dollar is at the top of the world hierarchy, in the first sense.

In the second sense, money is much more than a claim on real goods and services, because the rich consume their fill of real goods and services but have money left over. 

In other words there is far more money in the world than real goods and services for sale. World GDP is about $80 trillion but world capital is close to $1 quadrillion.

If money were simply an IOU for real goods and services, there would be no reason to accumulate so much more money than is needed to satiate real needs.

Money becomes a way of keeping score; two rich individuals can compete not by showing off their toys but by comparing bank accounts.

The point is that your second notion of money as a claim on real goods and services does not account for there being far more money in existence than real goods or services for sale.

Your way of thinking about money as a claim on something real thus discounts the vast volumes of financial sector money. But this discounting does not occur on any balance sheets: the financial dollars on JP Morgan's balance sheet are indistinguishable from real economy dollars. They are only not used for real consumption because investors already have all the real goods they want. 

According to your theory, there should be much more inflation than we see, because there is so much more money than real goods and services.

My point is that there is much more room for money printing, because money is not limited in any way by the amount of real production capacity. Money today far exceeds production but it does not produce unwanted inflation because people buy financial goods.

&gt; I stand by my assertion that all money is debt.

But central banks cannot guarantee that each existing dollar will buy you so much real production, because the amount of dollars far exceeds real production. Monetary policy has failed spectacularly to keep the amount of dollars in the world equal to the amount of real goods and services for sale. The extra money is not really a debt; it's more like a pure asset, valuable in and of itself.

Bezos doesn't continue to increase his net worth so he can buy real things; he is thinking of his money like points in a game.

My point is that printing money for a basic income does not really violate any sense of trust in central banks maintaining the value of money as a claim on real goods and services. That sense of trust would have been violated already long ago, as the volume of money in existence long ago surpassed the goods and services for sale.",Money and inflation.,fcjfbo0,"&gt; Professor Mehrling talked about outside money which is no one's liability; that money is not debt. The Fed's created dollars are its own liability. If you ask the Fed to redeem a $20, i.e. give you what it owes you for the paper money IOU, the Fed gives you another $20.

Whether something is inside money or outside money depends on which level of the hierarchy we're looking at.  If we look at the hierarchy as a whole, all money can be inside money.

Money is debt in two ways:
1. It's an IOU for higher money in the hierarchy.
2. It's an IOU for goods and services from the economy, backstopped by institutions.

You're right that gold is not the first form of debt.  It's at the top of the hierarchy.  But if we're using it as money, it's still the second form of debt.  Institutions manage gold flows and manage the credit superstructure that exists on top of gold to keep the purchasing power of gold stable.

This characteristic becomes more explicit with fiat money.  A dollar bill is a liability of the Fed in the sense that Fed is promising that ""the economy is good for it.""  When you're at the top of the hierarchy, there's a split between who makes the promise (the Fed) and who fulfills the promise (the economy as a whole).

The dollar bill is explicitly recorded as a liability on the Fed's balance sheet.  But it doesn't have to be.  That's just an accounting convention.  If they wanted to, they could spend the money and forget about it.

You *could* develop a similar accounting convention for gold.  Any time some gold is mined, some ""central bank"" somewhere adds it as a liability on their balance sheet.  Perry Mehrling says, ""Gold is an asset that's no-one's liability.""  But it doesn't have to be that way.  What he's emphasizing is that it's at the top of the hierarchy.

Could you imagine an economy using a currency that's in no way managed by institutions?  Sure.  But there's still a sense in which the money is debt because people trust that the economy owes them goods and services in exchange for their beads, or shells, or acorns, or whatever.

&gt; Thus, not all money is debt, as Howlett stated. Gold is no one's liability when it is first extracted. Bitcoins are also created through energy and code; they are not ""owed"" to anyone; after creation they are a pure asset without a corresponding liability.

I stand by my assertion that all money is debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

People need a robust safety net that allows them to take risks and fail without life degrading massively.  UBI doesn't accomplish that.

128,"Well, he kind of reminds me of Ted Bundy, but I don't care about that. Really pay attention to the way that he speaks. His main thing is that he's for democracy. Who isn't for democracy? It's an easy applause line. But when you really get down to the substance, not the slogans, he's against voting rights for felons. Agree or not, it's dishonest. You can't say ""I'm for democracy"" while at the same time saying ""I'm against voting rights for this group of people (due to our racist justice system, many felons are black)"". Andrew Yang actually has a policy to keep money out of politics, and thereby ensure a more democratic system. That policy is ""democracy dollars."" Andrew Yang is also more democratic in this sense: he supports lowering the voting age to 16. I have seen no calls by Buttigieg to do that. Furthermore, he's been wishy-washy about statehood for Puerto Rico.

Another thing that disturbs me about Pete is his anti-whistleblower stance. He said he didn't like it when Chelsea Manning got clemency, and when he was mayor, when a black police officer tried to come forward and call out some of the racist comments that people in the department were making, he punished the black cop for coming out with that information.

In fact, he was a bad mayor in general. He likes to tout the margin by which he was re-elected, but the fact is that for the last forty years, his town has only elected Democratic mayors, and when he ran for statewide office, he lost in a landslide. He likes to call South Bend a ""turnaround town"" due to his leadership, but that's just a slogan. It's not true. In fact, every year he's been mayor, crime has gone up, and the debt has skyrocketed with no discernible positive results. He's even banned homeless encampments. Why is this guy running as a Democrat for president?

Another thing that Buttigieg likes to tout around is his smarts. He's a Rhodes Scholar! Well, so is Cory Booker, a competing Democrat with more accomplishments than Buttigieg. Do you know who else was a Rhodes Scholar? Former Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal. And I'm sure that we can all agree that Bobby Jindal would have been a terrible president.

Of course, it has to be reiterated that he has stated that Democrats should focus more on values than on policies. Again, that's great if you want applause lines, but when it comes down to voting for you, why should I vote for someone who doesn't have policies, or someone who waits until the polls are out before he decides what his policies should be? Even if he does come out with policies, I find it hard to trust him. He recently had a ""stop Sanders"" dinner with Pelosi, Schumer, etc. Are they going to be his policies, or will they be Pelosi's policies?

Besides, I do think he's too young. I don't care about ""inter-generational justice"". I don't care if the decisions you make will affect your generation the most. I don't want a millennial president. I don't want someone who was too young to vote for Bill Clinton(by the way, he endorsed Hillary over Bernie, if you care), and just barely old enough to vote for Bush Jr. He's not old enough to understand politics enough to be president. If there's anything I agree with Reagan on, it's this: ""I won't hold your youth and inexperience against you."" The idea that this goofy kid has more experience than anyone in the field is laughable, and should be treated as such, every time he tries to make the argument.

Now, most of this stuff could be forgiven if he had some pressing, unique, and important policy proposals, like how Yang's inexperience can be forgiven because of his support for a UBI and many other important issues. But besides increasing the number of supreme court justices, there's not anything particularly compelling about his campaign. He has of course stated that a UBI was ""in consideration"", but many politicians have said that, like Tulsi Gabbard, who is more anti-war and pro-transparency than Pete. You get points for being for something, not for considering something.

If you stand for nothing, you don't have a mandate. The government is of course bought off by the corporations, but the government has to maintain some degree of PR. It has to pretend that it is at least slightly democratic. Genuine or not, Pete is perceived as standing for nothing, thus, he has no mandate, and the corporations would have nothing to fear. He would probably pass a public option, and roll back some of the Trump policies, and consider that a victory. His vision, to the extent that he has any vision, is pretty much just the current Democratic platform vision. Yang would have a strong mandate to pass a UBI. Would it be as much as he proposes? No. It might increase to 500 dollars over the next four years. But it would be something to expand upon, and Yang's ideas, which are very practical, would push the Democratic platform strongly to the left in a way that Buttigieg would not. Buttigieg is more or less just a centrist with a smile, someone to make you feel good about voting for nothing.","Political affiliations, Public services and healthcare.",elpyivs,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

My point was that if you apply that to a social security system (volunteer only, charitable contribution only), then you get high elder poverty.  The only change from history to now is the internet, so perhaps an argument could be made that the ease of ability to raise volunteer funds would change the outcome.   It seems like a weak argument.

If we want to have a conversation about whether UBI or Negative Income would work better than specifically the American system or specifically the Australian system (or any other nation), then that is a very different, much more detailed discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of the varieties of systems.  I personally think the end result of the discussion is like discussing parenting strategies.  Lots of different ones can work, so long as the execution remains consistent and the person in charge does things the right way.

Australia raises less revenue and puts less into that system from a government standpoint and it unsurprisingly has much higher elder poverty than every OECD country except for South Korea.  That's the big input, that's the big output.  

As for the current system in practically every country, we have a young group having less children, and an old group that didn't die in war or sickness, and so the systems are showing that stress of a temporary elderly heavy period of time.  That will continue to do so for 25 years, and then it appears we will go towards a demographic between those two amounts.  There's a macroeconomic discussion to be had that money is really a representation in the trading of work hours, and so ""saving"" banked work hours to redeem at another time is ultimately a philosophical faith network.  If you follow. 

There is likely no such thing as a perfect system, and in my opinion you will find (as in life) that the quest for perfect gets in the way of the best one that is doable and executable with a bunch of people who like to argue with one another and change their minds.   We will never get to live in a group of hundreds of millions without lots of arguing and lots of changing of ones mind.   That's also a human nature issue we all have to recognize.

I think it would be great to test UBI or negative income.  I would like to see people put up a very large test market to see if it would work better.   But we should recognize that saying ""Better"" comes with an understanding that we are both working towards a large group of people living outside of poverty with the same equivalent amount of work done as a group with a large amount in desperate poverty and a small amount in extreme wealth.   We might not be both working towards that, and that's fine too.   But that's a lot of different debate points within one discussion we can get derailed on.  ","Taxonomy:

Funny you found the link on Australia because that's where I am and we do have compulsory retirement funds and the article you linked makes it seem like it isn't working very well. (This is more just bonus info) Also our government are changing dividend payouts which will affect (mainly) retirees requiring a 9% bigger portfolio to withdraw the same amount that they do now. This is just a proposed policy, however it is very likely it will be introduced after the next election. Having your retirement handled by the government opens you up to these policy risks.

Our system is the one I was complaing about and it works in the form of Superannuation which currently 9.5% of your wage is added and placed into a retirement fund by your employer. So if you're earning $1,000 a week your employer places an extra $95 to your superannuation fund (this 9.5% is tax free). You're unable to touch these funds until you're 60 years of age and to qualify for our pension fund you need to be 65.5 years of age.

Just so I'm not diverging away from your original comment, do you mind reconsolidating your original stance? Because before I was under the impression it was for compulsory retirement funds which I do disagree with. I'm pretty sure we'd both agree on a Negative Income Tax which is a much simpler streamlined solution which acheives the same ends, placing poor people (young and old) out of extreme poverty but in a much more efficient way.

That's not quite what I'm saying.

&gt; but every action can be executed incorrectly; and taking no action would be incorrect by default.

This is circular reasoning.

Let's imagine a hypothetical scenario: ""the government"" implements UBI, and it works well for a year, and then spectacularly fails. Maybe another government then gets elected and completely ruins the system, because people voted for a party that would dramatically increase the UBI. Hyperinflation occurs, the currency is now worthless.

Has UBI failed? Or was it just because that 2nd government botched it, but UBI was a great idea? The answer to that question is *undefined*. The question itself is meaningless. In the reality that we exist in, there are only actions and consequences. (And actions can't be correct or incorrect, they just are). There is no ""should"". Ideas and thoughts are just that.

You cannot separate ""the idea"" of UBI from ""actions performed by people"". There is only cause and effect.

So to be intellectually honest, you have to model a system where a group of people in government introduce UBI to the best of their ability, and then whatever happens will happen.

**However, I actually support the idea of something similar to UBI**, in the sense that I think it, or something like it, is inevitable. Or something completely different that we can't foresee. I just don't like the idea of ""smart people with great ideas planning stuff"".

&gt; the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that suffering will always be a part of life for everyone

They state that there is no ""free energy"". Ie, you cannot create or destroy energy. (Although you can convert it to and from matter). But more importantly, entropy always increases over time.

This means that all living things must die, all material possessions eventually break. There are finite resources, and humans can achieve a finite amount things.

This is the root cause of what the Christians call ""original sin"" and psychologists call ""ego"". It's why you differentiate yourself from the chair you are sitting on. ""You"" are you, and the chair is not you, it is a chair.

I try to explain how UBI should be done, to help improve the odds, in a small way, that it might actually be done well. If people understand the macroeconomics, it increases the odds it will work, rather than be botched, leading to suffering on a mass scale.

Of course we cannot avoid the possibility of suffering on a mass scale because we botch things. That's what we often do.

161,"&gt; Here's some of the many problems. First, there is the question of what time scale to operate on. Is this indexing checked once a year? Twice? Every month? Every five years? Every time the benefit changes, that has a ripple effect on costs and it becomes instantly out-dated. And you literally can't build a compensation factor into the equation because that ALSO affects costs.

Yeah, that's one of the major blocks that is being discussed over here. We're looking into moving income taxation to monthly based, which is seen as a step towards UBI being even possible to implement.

&gt; This leads us to another big problem. The universal scale of UBI means comparing it to traditional welfare is pointless. Giving 5% of the population money has a negligible effect on markets. Giving 100% of the population money has an overwhelming effect on the cost of absolutely everything.

We are already giving benefits to 100% of the population here, through maternity, child, retirement and student benefits for example. Again, everything should be crashing already according to you but it isn't. Weird, huh.

Also - I do see where you're coming from (more money is bad) but do you really think the question is the *proportion of population receiving the money* rather than the amount of money? That is; which would be worse: 100% of the population each receiving 5c each per year of 5% of the population each receiving $2.5B per year? For bonus points, calculate at which size of population the amount would be the same..

&gt; But it's not possible. You have to show an effort to find a job, don't you? Isn't there a time limit to how long you can remain on the dole? It appears that staged cut-off points occur at 100 days and 500.

No, I'm not talking about unemployment benefits but the 'social assistance' that is provided to people who, for example, don't qualify for unemployment benefits. See [here](http://www.kela.fi/web/en/social-assistance), but the gist of it is that if your income is less than €487, the government makes up the rest so everyone gets at least that amount of money per month, period. 

How familiar are you with the Finnish social security system, as you seem to present an image of knowing about it yet fail to know the very basics?

&gt; As I explained above, the UBI payments in and of themselves make the cost of living higher. You are asserting a logical impossibility. These benifits alter costs. The moment a raise goes into effect, it is no longer sufficient because it's made everything more expensive.

Okay, you just don't understand. That's all fine and dandy, but unless you even try to understand, I fear all the explanations in the world will do you no good.

Your metaphor of X=X+1 just proves it and using that as some sort of a proof of UBI being 'mathematically impossible' is at best laughable.

Please do NOT tell me I don't understand something when all you are doing to asserting a party line that is illogical on its face. It is because I DO understand the UBI that I see that it is impossible.

If X is not zero, solve for X in this equation.

X = X+1

It can't be done. UBI is a mathematical impossibility.

Purchasing power is a product of supply and demand. Demand is in part a product of what funds are available to the consumers. Therefore, if you elevate the supply of funds, you elevate the demand. In this specific case, ""demand"" is best expressed as ""what are you able to pay for staples"". Given that all this also plays into what it costs to lure a person into employment, the producers must charge all that the market will bear. It's important to remember that what market can bear *does not* mean that everyone can afford the thing. Pricing *some* people out of the market is how what the market can bear is determined.

Amazon and every other business is only going to be paying taxes on the difference between what they buy and sell products for, which for a low margin company like Amazon is *very fucking little*. Essentially you're going to be giving *more* money and power to these massive corporations which can survive on razor thin margins and fucking over small/medium sized businesses who don't have the volume to compete. *Most* of the tax will be paid by the end consumer (i.e. you) so even if all of that gets funneled back to you through UBI the actual benefits will be marginal at best, and it'll 100% fuck over anyone not receiving UBI or who have their existing benefits slashed to pay for this stupid idea.

False. Or rather, this same argument could be made as to why it's perfectly fine that mega corporations like amazon, google and netflix pay zero in taxes - it's utter fucking nonsense. Even if there is a slight increase in consumer prices, the fact of the matter is that people earning above the poverty line who don't have to pay for health care in a single payer system is going to be fine, particularly if most of the necessary items that poor people are buying are exempt.

I think this hits at the crux of the issue.  There are certain rights that I believe can be legitimately claimed to be ""fundamental"" to a free society like freedom of speech, religion, the press, etc..  And good on the founding fathers for recognizing and enshrining many of those things.

But they could not possibly have imagined the notion of a ""post-scarcity world"", as some have termed the direction they feel society is headed.  They could not have imagined that technology would have gotten so efficient as to replace the labor of literally thousands of workers, and the consequences of that with respect to tax policy.

It's great that the US Constitution has been so forward-thinking and I would agree that by and large it's an effective set of founding principles with which to govern a society.  So good, in fact, that the door has been left open for it to be amended to change with the times as needed.  In theory, the First Amendment could be repealed or modified by another Amendment, not that there's any serious discussion of doing so.

&gt;If a constitutional amendment is needed to enable whatever brilliant outcome we arrive at, so be it. 

Exactly this.  We need not be constrained about what is currently written down in the Constitution for a discussion of this nature.  Although, I have yet to see any tax policy advanced by a politician or President that would run afoul of what's currently written there.  The Constitution grants rather broad powers to tax, so the minutiae about how we go about it (UBI, to pick a current radical example) is left for Congress and the states to decide.

The question that OP is really asking, I think, is ""what should be the role of government in society"", which is about as foundational a question as there can possibly be in the realm of politics.  It's almost so foundational as to be pointless to discuss due to how broad it is, but I think /u/higherbrow 's response is much more eloquent a statement than I could make on that topic.","Taxonomy:

Yes, states based on law need a ""highest law"" of some kind, no question, but ask an average Australian what's in our constitution and no-one has any idea. In case you're interested, it mainly deals with meta-law, like who has the authority to have a military force, the structure of government, the circumstances under which the leader can be dismissed, etc. There is very little on what taxation is allowed or not allowed, and certainly nothing as specific as what speech is allowed or whether or not we can have guns.

So my question is this: Why restrict your question to within the laws of the constitution at all? If we're going to talk about taxes, let's open up the whole playing field!

Who cares what the founding fathers intended hundreds of years ago, they had no problem with slavery (in general) so why should their opinions on any topic (such as taxation) by assumed to be enlightened?

I think the universal part is the most important part of the UBI scheme. 

I feel like when I talk to my older relatives, they have very different views on things like Social Security/Medicare vs something like welfare/food stamps. As far as I can tell, the first belong to a group of benefits that everyone pays into and everybody benefits from. So they would shout bloody murder if anyone threatened to take those away because ""I earned it, it's my right to collect."" And there's no stigma of my grandma accepting SS and using Medicare because so are all her friends, rich or poor. Even if she is far more dependent on it than they are, that does not seem to matter. 

Yet with welfare, Medicaid, etc, their attitude is that the recipients are moochers. ""Why the hell should my hard-earned money pay for their housing?"" ""Why isn't the govt helping me too, I'm poor but not quite poor enough."" There is a huge stigma here against those programs, and it creates resentment for those on the other side of the qualifying line.

188,"In reading the comments below, it seems we need to clarify what progressives are most concerned about Yang's UBI proposal. 

My understanding of Yang's UBI proposal is that if someone opts into UBI, they replace all the social/welfare benefits with $12000 each year. As a result, the person now has to pay for all the services they were getting from welfare programs (including income tax - average is 14.2%, and 10% VAT added on top of local sales tax on non-basic goods) with their own $12000 in cash, and hence the net dollar amount that the person gets at the end is a net of $0 or a net of maybe a few hundred dollars (not enough to make any significant difference).

One alternative proposal would be to ""stack"" UBI (I think I'm using this term correctly) on top of social welfare so that everyone that is receiving welfare benefits ALSO receives the $12000 in cash. However, the $12000 received should NOT count as earned income in order to prevent someone from getting bounced out of the welfare programs. And to be fair to all, the $12000 received should not be counted in earned taxable income for everyone (not just welfare recipients). The downside is that this would add .60 to .80 trillion dollars to make the total cost of funding UBI at 3.8 trillion. Furthermore, excluding the $12000 from taxable earned income would mean that 14.2% (average amount of income tax paid per person) of the UBI money would not be coming back into the UBI fund via income tax revenue.

A simpler alternative is to stack UBI on top of welfare recipients, raise the welfare recipient's cut-off income level by $12000 so that recipients continue to receive the welfare services, and make the $12000 count as taxable earned income.","- Non-UBI government welfare programs

Ok, my history pre-dates you a bit.  My family was affected by the recessions of the 70's, 80's, 90's, 2000's and will be affected to some degree by this one.  I have a background in finance and find economic history very interesting.  

Oh I'm sure some people do like their insurance the way it is, but the popularity of Medicare for all nonetheless speaks to itself. The issue of insurance is of course that it costs so much, and it can't ever cost less - the reason national health services provide such high quality but cheap healthcare (about 2-1000x cheaper depending on treatment) is that it can negotiate prices with external entities on bulk - it's the basic concept of a trading bloc.

The point I am making is this.  According to recent polls 85% of people are happy with their insurance.  They don't want to be forced into a plan they don't want.  The thing that the medicare for all people don't get is exactly this point.

I have googled plenty - not about cost though.  About efficiency and quality.

Here are some for you:

""This edition of Waiting Your Turn indicates that, overall, waiting times for medically necessary treatment have increased since last year. Specialist physicians surveyed report a median waiting time of 20.9 weeks between referral from a general practitioner and receipt of treatment—longer than the wait of 19.8 weeks reported in 2018. This year’s wait time is just shy of the longest wait time recorded in this survey’s history (21.2 weeks in 2017) and is 124% longer than in 1993, when it was just 9.3 weeks.

There is a great deal of variation in the total waiting time faced by patients across the provinces. Ontario reports the shortest total wait—16.0 weeks—while Prince Edward Island reports the longest—49.3 weeks. There is also a great deal of variation among specialties. Patients wait longest between a GP referral and orthopaedic surgery (39.1 weeks), while those waiting for medical oncology begin treatment in 4.4 weeks.""

On the note of the new deal, I mean you're ignoring the fact I said culminating of course. Huge sociopolitical progress before the Great Depression too including introduction of minimum wages and better rights for workers. But all of it including the response to the Great Depression was a result of socialist activism - the businesses of the 1930's were at that moment pressuring America not to make the New Deal, Roosevelt simply had no choice: revolution was the alternative.

It was the depression that created the need for the new deal.  That is the point.  The cure was temporary works type projects to build roads and dams etc.  It was a way of helping people get back on their feet so that we could resume a normal life.  The truth is though that WWII is what really snapped things back into shape.  War production, pent up demand from those returning from the war and lack of international competition were all involved.

Sure, people like free stuff won't dispute that. That's not a reason against liking UBI - the whole point is voters choose what they'd like in their country. Reasons in favour however include: it's perfectly affordable with the right taxation on large businesses benefitting from productivity gains from scientific innovations, it would rejuvenate the economy and make it more robust to recessions, it would prevent a revolution as job losses continue to increase both temporarily under COVID but generally as a result of those productivity increases. Oh and of course the huge bi-partisan group of political and economic experts who back the concept.

This is all based on assumptions.  Please point me to researched facts in this area.

If you can't see the various factors in voting behaviour that had effects I'm not going to be able to go through them all here but includes: backlash in democratic base against Trump election means they want to play it safe - Biden is presented as that candidate. Also: Bernie and Warren split each others base while DNC organised a collapse of moderate base options to just Biden with Warren only dropping out after her splitting of Bernie's base hit all the wind out of his momentum in a campaign that is hugely momentum-dependent.

Do some research to see just how conservative the democratic base is..All those folks down south have a much different opinion on things than people on the coasts.  So do the democrats in the middle of the country.

""A 2015 Gallup poll found that 19% of **Democrats** identified themselves as **conservative**, a decline of 6% from 2000. In 2018, Gallup's ideology polling found that 35% of **Democrats** self-identified as moderate and 13% identified as **conservative**; 50% of **Democratic** respondents described their ideology as liberal.""

The idea that you aren't beholden to somebody in someway is ridiculous, that's society. We all depend on one another in some way to keep our system going.

Lets replace food stamps, housing assistance, unemployment, and the other 177 federal programs currently running in the United States with a Minimum Basic Income.

An MBI is a federal guarantee to an income no matter what, it isn't given to every adult over 18, it's an income safety net.

Let's put it at $20,000 (more than double the poverty line).

If you earned nothing for a year you get $20,000.

If you earned $5,000 you would get $22,500 (before taxes) and after 10% in taxes (assuming only income above the MBI is taxable) you get $22,250.

If you earned $20,000 your income would be $30,000 before taxes, and after you would take home $29,000.

If you earned $35,000 your income would be $37,500 and after taxes your take home would be $35,750.

This way there is never an incentive to not work.

This way there is actually less spending overall as 177 federal programs can be cut to just 1 or a few.

&gt;  it's a drop in the bucket compared to medical expenses. What good is $1k a month when you have tens of thousands in medical bills?

Medical expenses are over-inflated because of the way insurance and medicine profit off each other. Suggesting that UBI is useless because people have ______ somehow cancels out any benefit UBI offers is just nonsensical. What you're looking for is reforming healthcare, which Yang has in his many policies and he is Medicare for All.

https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/

I have debt (regardless of medical)- $12k a year starting at 18 is practically the same as $0? You wouldn't benefit from $1k a month? That's money for your family that everyone gains as stakeholders in society.

&gt; It'll make high education more of an option, but not nearly as much as tuition free Community Colleges or Universities. 

Okay, so we have everyone graduating college and university... Instantly devalues college education and makes for a high school equivalent. You are not going to get a better education if there is an exorbitant number of people attending schools.

You have to know there are programs like FAFSA and scholarships that can pay your education just by being a not terrible student as well... You're already provided a subsidized experience if you put in the effort.

That's not to say Yang doesn't want to reform higher education- it is unjustly priced. ""The cost of college has increased, but the education hasn't improved.""

312,"&gt; Yes but the point is whether or not there is enough actual demand for salaried labor to capture the decreased demand for wage labor resultant from automation.

That seems likely, some areas are in great need of people. In fact most things technology and information related are in need. Engineering is another area with a lot of extremely varied branches which is normally in need of people. Qualified nurses and other types of personal care, are also in many places something sought after.

And the fact is that so far, automation only takes a very limited portion of jobs which can easily fill other gaps, if education takes precedence.

&gt;Given the context of Trump, I assumed we were discussing America. I don't pretend to speak outside that context.

Well, yes, but it is relevant in that context. I believe Trump pretty much wants the government out of education.

&gt;You have to look at the whole system which includes the manufacture, maintenance and decommission of machines. Maintenance is so much more than just turning the thing on as well.

Yes, but the system as a whole for people is at the very least equally as troublesome. After all, who do you think all the pollution and consumption is for?

&gt;Yeah pretty much and I really wish they would call UBI what it is, subsidization for automation.

No, it's the establishment of a way of living where you don't fear not having enough to eat. It's another big leap in our social evolution, and it should impact us in the same order of magnitude as the industrialisation did when it made many goods very easily accessible.

Just because it was made possible by automation, doesn't mean it is subsidisation of automation, automation does not depend on it, at all. We know this because automation does happen, and UBI does not. There are many other upsides to automating. (e.g. people are not at risk, can produce more, is  often more precise and reliable, etc.)

Every company, automated or not, should pay a tax depending on their estimated environmental impact, even people do so. I can't vouch for America, but it seems rather common sense, so I'm assuming there's some sort of similar tax over there.

&gt;I don't particularly buy into the rhetoric of progress myself so that doesn't have much sway with me.

Or do you simply believe that not having to be dependent on work in order to be able to survive would not be progress?",Automation and jobs.,d5s2jf6,"&gt; Hardly, there are many careers which pay increasingly and extremely well. You can't judge it by how many people choose certain areas that don't really need a lot of people to begin with.

Yes but the point is whether or not there is enough actual demand for salaried labor to capture the decreased demand for wage labor resultant from automation. 

&gt; To be fair, that's mostly an American problem as far as I know, which imo is in many ways more pressing than any immigration issues or even other hot topics such as religion. I have a Master's degree and got out of University with zero debt, and I didn't come out of a rich family, it just wasn't very expensive.

Given the context of Trump, I assumed we were discussing America. I don't pretend to speak outside that context. 

&gt; That depends a lot on the type of automation. A few examples come to mind, the self-checkout at the supermarket, or machines capable of serving heated food. Those rely on energy from the grid, which depending on where you live and how it is implemented can at times come from 100%, or nearly so, renewable sources.

You have to look at the whole system which includes the manufacture, maintenance and decommission of machines. Maintenance is so much more than just turning the thing on as well. 

&gt; That's why things like basic income are such hot topics nowadays. It's just getting less and less needed for everyone to work or at least for everyone to work full time. Why should we go back instead of walking towards such a future? It isn't happening today, no, but it's not happening any time either if we don't go ahead and automate things.

Yeah pretty much and I really wish they would call UBI what it is, subsidization for automation. It should be funded as a tax on companies which choose to automate. They should also have to pay heavily for emissions to capture the environmental costs of machine labor.

Democracy certainly has a lot of failures, but it is absurd to expect all people to deeply understand all things. That is why we vote representatives, who should we following the experts. They don’t because of both democracy (and really more blind party voting in a two party system than democracy itself) and capitalism. They directly stay in power from corporations that bank roll their campaign funds. 

But are you suggesting that if we had another form of government we wouldn’t see these issues? Like if we went to a dictatorship everything would be solved? 

The regulation are put in because capitalism is so predatory. It has so many flaws that it has to be heavily regulated. That is not a feather in its cap. And everything not specifically written in law is just another loophole for capitalism to exploit. 

So are you saying you believe the US, a far more aggressive culture, fails because it is aggressive? Certainly that is a part of it. But other capitalistic countries aren’t this great haven that everyone should model. Capitalism is exploitive and needs to be heavily hybridized. My point is that pure capitalism (or pure socialism or pure whatever) doesn’t work. The current system is too heavily capitalistic. 

We so disagree on capitalism and Marvel. Marvel is greedy because of capitalism. Marvel is following the current capitalistic laws. Marvel paying more money than it has to is not maximizing profits. The mindset is so deeply embedded because of capitalism. 

I like how you are being dumb and pretending like a mindsets don’t matter. That there is nothing inherited wrong with capitalism. It breeds a mentality of greed. But no play a word game and pretend that greed is coming from humans and capitalism is separate. If you believe that, you think Americans are inherently trash with no influence from capitalism. And the other countries issues aren’t capitalistic but something else. Feel free to clarify.  

No I am not angry nor a college kid. Perhaps as you lob your insults you instead try to not be an ass. Probably too much to ask for since you have taken this you know it all approach. Let me give you some advice, you will 100% never get someone to see your side being a jerk to them. If you actually cared about people or educating them you would learn to first ask questions and then have a discussion with them. 

And where did I say we need to remove all aspects of capitalism. I have argued against pure capitalism. Something you seem to agree with while arguing the naming conventions. Do you know what you are arguing for? You say you want UBI, some form or redistribution, etc. You are saying you want a hybridization and somehow still arguing with me. Like seriously what am I missing?

Long sigh. Well, this is going to be a long pointless discussion, I have a feeling.

So I'm guessing you are Norwegian. Cool. But no, you're not socialist.

Norway is 100% without a doubt or without any ambiguity a capitalist country.

Most countries apart from the US have socialist programs, such as welfare, but they are part of a capitalist framework.

Do businesses and business owners own capitol in Norway? Does Norway have landlords? Do the workers control the means of production?

Those are rhetorical questions, the answer to all is no, because Norway is capitalist.

&gt; Capitalism is the system we lean heaviest on. It is also why we have so many problems.

Capitalism is the system that defines your society. Don't be shy.

As for why we have so many problems? It's not capitalism but democracy. That's the real problem.

&gt; Things like the Climate Crisis and the difficulties fixing it are tied to capitalism and the corporations paying to slow or stop the shift to a fix.

This is due to democracy not capitalism. Until we keep letting crowds of people who have no idea vote, that won't get fixed.

A capitalism alternative won't fix stupidity, and may even heighten it.

&gt; Things like the minimum wage had to be put in place because of how badly Americans were taking advantage of Americans.

This is an example of regulation being a fix to a problem with capitalism. Doing things like setting a high minimum, setting taxes, setting firm rules for the market etc all can solve problems, and all are consistent with capitalism.

&gt; A minimum wage that hasn’t even moved with inflation in decades because capitalist see another exploit.

Look at other capitalist countries that do have reasonable minimum wages and don't have the problems the US does though.

And look at the last election.Every democratic candidate except Biden was incredibly progressive and would have done a lot to fix things, but no, we ended up with Biden. Because of democracy. Because people are idiots and letting them vote is a mistake.

&gt; How are you going to say Marvel not paying people any additional money isn’t capitalism?

Because it has nothing to with with capitalism, it's just a choice made by a company. If Marvel did show goodwill and pay their creators 10 times what they did (which I think someone mentioned would not affect their bottom line at all), guess what? That is *also* nothing to do with capitalism.

&gt; And yes we literally write laws to fix problems in the system. So it depends on how and where the altercations in the system for how and where the fixes are.

Sure, that is consistent with me saying regulation solves many of the problems you wrongly think are inherit with capitalism.

&gt; Ah yes Americas perfect and people wanting a better system are wrong/s

Way to misunderstand a point. Are you an angry college kid who hasn't properly read up on most of the things you want to argue about, by chance?

I also want to fix things. Enough that I've applied to do a PhD on modeling different forms of governments, because I honestly see democracy as an issue and I think we can do so much better.

We can do much more to protect peoples rights, do better with wealth redistribution, make a lot less stuff illegal, drastic prison and justice system reform, much better welfare systems, UBI, etc etc etc. 

And yet, as a small business owner, I ant to keep many elements of capitalism. I like the idea of having a vision and essentially managing a project to bring it to life, and know I don't think workers need more than what they are paid (at least not in a society with UBI and reasonable minimum wage).

It's just frustrating on reddit when people want to make everything about capitalism and try to attack capitalism but they very obviously really haven't thought it through at all.

In a few cities they put spikes on the curbs and areas of the sidewalks where people would sit or have a nap. 

Times Square really isn’t where you’re going to find homeless people. They get kicked out of Grand Central, and Times Square is just a train stop and tourist spot, there’s nothing special about it otherwise. Homeless people aren’t hanging out in Times Square very much because as soon as one tourist complains to a cop (who are *everywhere* they’re removed from the area. Besides, most of the daily traffic there is commuters coming from the Metro North to get to work who aren’t going to stop and dig for change to give out when they’re already running late. 

Boston’s a bit better- the homeless people beg in certain areas where metro isn’t patrolling the T, but at night, several camp out on the common. It’s a good spot- there’s gazebos so there’s shelter, a Burger King right across the street, plenty of people willing to help them out with food and it’s a safe area. They’re not bothering anyone, and they only set up camp after events and whatnot are done for the night. That’s about the extent of the homeless you’ll actually see in Boston. 

In most major cities, the homeless are relegated to what we call “skid row” which isn’t actually a street name, but the colloquial term for the section of town where the homeless all live. In my town which isn’t a city, they mostly live at the abandoned drive-in theatre behind a grocery store. 

We have no basic income, public housing is limited to those with children and the disabled with a year minimum wait time and you can only get on the waiting list within a short window once a year. Shelters are limited and first come first serve, and there’s just not enough room for even half the people in need. We’ve got a serious problem with poverty, but it’s a lot more likely to be addressed if it’s visible and impossible to ignore. 

**Tl;dr:** homeless people are hidden here because it makes the cities look bad but there’s nowhere else for them to go, so they fuck off during the day and make camp where they can at night when there aren’t hoards of tourists complaining to the police.

The study you linked to also does not disagree with what I just wrote. It too says the issue is complex, adjusts the gap for various factors, and reaches a smaller but still real gap. 

It then goes on to hypothesize, the gap as it exists might just be entirely due to women *wanting* to earn less, because of reasons like preferring benefits, part time work, and more family friendly jobs.

I don't know why some feel it's important to believe that men and women are entirely equal in earned income ability, and that women earn less than men because they want to, but let's even assume that's the case.

Is it okay that women earn less than men because they are the ones having the babies? Someone has to have babies to continue the species. Women happen to biologically be the ones who get to do this. This requires they take maternity leave. This then usually involves women being the primary care giver. This results in women needing certain jobs that offer certain different things than men. Is that okay that we view all of this as fair? That because women are the childbearers and spend more time caring for kids, that they should earn less income? It's all just choice? Is being born with ovaries a life choice?

Seems to me that there's actually an argument to be made that there should be a gap that leans toward women, and that women should actually be paid more to balance it all out.

I'm not going to argue for that though. I just feel we need a UBI, and that when it helps certain groups more than others, be it women or minorities, that this is yet another plus of basic income. ",Education and family.,cmnmuvu,"&gt; However, that too is not so simple, because some of these jobs that pay less pay less because long ago they were considered ""women's work"" and historically speaking, we have tended to value the labor of women less than men, just as we have for minorities.

I'm gong to need some citations for this, because last I checked, cashier/clerk was a man's job for quite a while, yet none of us here pretend they're making anything resembling a living these days.

To add to what one other commenter said, while what you said is true, this assumes that someone is willing to pay, and train, the majority of people to do the new, higher skilled things, and it assumes that most everyone is capable. Outside of some sort of UBI, there still have to be enough good paying jobs to put money in people's pockets to buy whatever is being sold, otherwise there won't be enough demand for these new things.

Certain free market economists theorize that with substantial automation there will be drastic drops in the price of goods, enabling people to have their money go further, which might be true, but it still doesn't necessarily solve the problem of getting that money into the hands of the many so that they can even buy anything in the first place.

First, I think AI and independently working robots are a long way off, as in a few hundred years, if not more. Our current AI is not even close to ""real"" AI. It is good at looking like AI, but it is *very* limited and needs constant human input. Thus, for a while longer, we will need humans.

The catch is, we will need skilled and educated humans, not humans that do unskilled labor, that is exactly what our robots are good at. I think in the near future, the solution is making humans as skilled as they can. There are some people who don't have the intelligence to do this, but I think there are a lot of people who are not given the opportunity to become skilled. I think, as a society, if we focus on giving these people the tools to become skilled, we can see a decrease in the number of unskilled workers. In the future, there will still be unskilled labor, just a lot less of it. We just need to try to educate as much as the work force as possible.

.

So, at the one extreme we have now, there is essentially an infinite amount of income inequality possible. The other extreme is a 100% income tax levied on all income, and equally distributed to everyone. This means everyone's income would be identical.

.

I also see the UBI as leading us to a meritocracy, which I find desirable. With that in mind, a 100% tax rate is not something I would like to see as it leads away from a meritocracy, but, on the flip side of that, I know that the current state leads away from meritocracy as wel. So there is, in my mind, some systematic sweet spot where people are free enough and incentivized enough to bring about a meritocracy.

.

$5,000 per month would require about a 100% income tax rate to fund (back of the envelope math), which, for me, means that my ideal future state would not be met. The common number of $12k could be funded by around a 25% income tax rate, which means that a quarter of all income is redistributed.

First off I would strongly suspect that anyone on benefits is not doing a cost/benefit analysis when considering whether or not to apply to jobs, and deciding that since it's only a 71% increase in their total revenue per month that they won't go for the job.
Additionally the reason that the hypothetical worker is more ""incentivized"" to get a job in an ""either or"" scenario because they have less money to start with. Unless I'm mis understanding something that argument is pretty much, ""keep the poor, poor so they are more desperate for a job."" Seems pretty regressive to me.",0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Citizens are paid UBI at the same time as these price increases. They can use their UBI to shop. Shopping with your UBI is spending the tax money taken from corporations. It's a cycle right?

That tax goes into a UBI program that splits the funds across citizens 18+ years old. Now corporations have paid out a chunk of money to fund our UBI, time to raise prices. But here we are with our UBI payouts and can shop with that money, which then goes into the corporation, earning it revenue which we tax and pay back into the UBI program. The cycle continues.

But it gets better. Under UBI you remove all social programs. No more welfare, no medicare, no Social Security, none of that stuff. Which means you save a lot of money on government overhead. Right now a ton of money is spent in the government trying to figure out who needs support. But if you support everyone equally then that is no longer needed.

I will give you a brief summary that is by no means intended as a deep dive analytical piece. If you want that start googling. 

1) In the case of America the front running idea for where to get the money amongst the UBI community is to just cannibalize all the existing welfare programs. The idea is that this saves a fortune on administrative costs since you have one program instead of like 50. This could provide a UBI in the US of about 9.9k annually for each nonincarcerated adult age 18 and up. If you want or need more find a job.

2) Assuming a UBI program is in place then the government would indeed act in part as a massive wealth distribution engine. The UBI community defense of this usually comes down to this being a cost of maintaining civil society. But yes, it is pretty Marxy for better of worse.

3) The incentive for capital owners would be the same as today. They would simply have more wealth and by extension freedom then some one just subsisting on their UBI. 

4) See item 3.

5) The point of currency would be the same as today. With a UBI you still have a system of capitalism. People still have the freedom to innovate, create and develop new ways to profit for themselves. The difference is that in this UBI scenario you have just put the capitalist market on top of a fiscal floor through which no person can fall. 

It's like when you play a game of Monopoly with all of those house rules like getting money from Free Parking that people add just to keep the game going. UBI is just one way of making it so the economically valueless can be market participates which is, I think, necessary as if they fall out of the market entirely then that will create massive political unrest and huge problems if the poor get desperate enough.

The financial sector box would then be 10 times as big as any of the other boxes.

Also, the Injections side is, again, at least 10 times bigger than the Leakages side, since banks lend out far more money that they take in deposits. When you go off-balance sheet through derivatives and subsidiaries and such, the fractional reserve limit on banking is not a real limit. Bankers can figure out how to get around it, when they want, and create far more money in the form of loans and derivatives than they have in reserves. Then they borrow daily in the money markets to put off final settlement for another day, to kick the can down the road. If the derivatives they created, which multiply the underlying physical assets many times, suddenly drop in value, the Fed is there to provide them the liquidity needed to keep their loans rolling over despite the sudden drop in the collateral they're offering.

Most of the people that have talent and strong work ethic are unlikely to be held back due to a lack of money, as their talent and work ethic makes them more likely to acquire better jobs with better pay. 

The main fear that holds people back from entrepreneurship is the fear that their business will fail. A UBI requires an increase in taxes which if placed on businesses make them more likely to fail and if placed on employees makes it take longer to amass the necessary wealth to start a business since the taxes taken will always be greater than the amount given back as UBI. This is because not everyone pays taxes, [approximately 45% of Americans pay no federal income tax](https://nypost.com/2016/02/24/45-percent-of-americans-pay-no-federal-income-tax/), but they will receive a UBI even if they are not contributing to it. 

On the other hand, lowering taxes on businesses will make them more likely to succeed and helps businesses to make changes to the way that they currently do business, such as hiring more people, investing in new technology, paying for advertisements, or lowering prices.

But in the end of the day when we relate to real life case studies, is the worker below minimum wage able to support themselves above poverty levels?

Essentially you are having similar issue that even I have when doing coding. Abstraction is good when optimizing a system, but you need to be careful not to cloud the bigger picture.

As well as the promotion of both positive liberty and negative liberty (refer to two concepts of liberty).

",Labor wages and work conditions.,cjci8oh,"Who said anything about negotiating wages upwards?  The idea behind what the minister said, is that many people who are unemployed are unemployed because their skill level provides a value to business that is below the price floor.  Therefore, it makes no sense for business to hire them.  A lucky group whose value falls below the minimum wage will get hired, however, if the price at which they're hired was allowed to fall to the equilibrium price, then many more would be hired. 

So your argument is basically:  fuck the people who fall below the price floor and remain unemployed, to the benefit of the lucky group who fall below the price floor but are employed. 

&gt;Again, the fact that they're on minimum wage at all is because they have no bargaining power. The minimum wage exists because these people have no bargaining power. If it didn't exist, people would be paid only enough to live on - maybe not even that (look at America where, even with a minimum wage, people have to work multiple jobs, to afford rent and food).

Of course they have bargaining power.  The value they bring is their bargaining power.  It's interesting that you mentioned the US, which has a minimum wage, but failed to mention the various highly developed countries in Western Europe which don't have a minimum wage. 

&gt;The problem we have, right now, is that for every job on offer, there are far too many job seekers, many of which are over-skilled for the role they're applying for.

When a country sets a price floor on wages, the number of jobs will be below what it would be without the price floor.  When a company has to pay at minimum wage, its marginal costs are higher than would be at equilibrium, and they will produce less than they otherwise would.

To qualify for what will be a [supersized Democratic debate](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/business/media/october-democratic-debate.html?module=inline) this month, presidential candidates had to receive at least 2 percent support in four polls sanctioned by the Democratic National Committee, as well as donations from at least 130,000 unique supporters. Some polled far higher than 2 percent, while others only just cleared the bar.

When survey results are that low, they are said to be within the “margin of error” of zero, meaning there’s technically a chance the candidate has close to no support at all.

“It’s not materially different than polling at zero,” Patrick Murray, the director of polling at Monmouth University, said in an interview.

But in this early stage of the campaign, candidates in that statistical no-go zone still stand a chance at gaining a lifeline by making it into a nationally televised debate.

The next Democratic debate, on Oct. 15, will feature 12 candidates, the most of any televised showdown in presidential campaign history. [Representative Tulsi Gabbard](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tulsi-gabbard.html?module=inline) of Hawaii and the billionaire hedge fund investor [Tom Steyer](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/tom-steyer.html?module=inline) both qualified for the October debate after narrowly missing out on September’s.

 

Ms. Gabbard’s poll numbers in qualifying national and state polls have hovered between 0 and 2 percent throughout the campaign. Mr. Steyer has not risen past 1 percent in any qualifying national surveys, but he has recently been accruing between 2 and 4 percent in polls of early-nominating states.

When a candidate’s poll numbers are this low, simply increasing name-recognition can play a significant role in reaching the threshold to make the debate stage.

“You have candidates that got in by basically doing things that strategically got their name recognition up enough that they could meet these very low polling marks,” Mr. Murray said.

“In Gabbard’s instance, three of her four qualifying polls have been in Iowa and New Hampshire, where she’s simply spent a lot of money on billboards to get her face and name out there,” he said. “Tom Steyer has quite literally bought himself name recognition in those early states, with online and TV advertising.”

Mr. Steyer has been spending millions of dollars over the past two years on TV advertisements calling for President Trump’s impeachment. The move has [irritated some members of his own party](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/us/politics/impeach-trump-democrats-tom-steyer.html?module=inline), but has also raised his profile significantly.

And with the House having recently opened an [impeachment inquiry](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/us/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry.html?module=inline) against the president, Mr. Steyer may take the opportunity to claim vindication on live television, in his first-ever debate appearance.

 

Other low-polling candidates have had more consistent numbers. [Andrew Yang](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/andrew-yang.html?module=inline), a businessman who has pledged that as president he would offer a monthly universal basic income of $1,000 to all American adults, has not missed a debate, and his numbers have inched steadily upward: He now averages over 3 percent in nationwide polls, [according to Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html), up from roughly 1 percent a few months ago.

Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic consultant who was President Barack Obama’s deputy campaign manager in 2012, said it was not atypical for an outsider like Mr. Yang — who has no background in politics — to command interest from a small but considerable portion of the electorate.

“There’s an appetite for the non-politician,” she said. “It doesn’t mean they make it over the finish line, but people are entertaining it at a marginal level.”

But as the debate season continues, the qualification criteria will only tighten, inevitably narrowing the field. At November’s debate, candidates will need at least 5 percent support in two polls in early-nominating states, or 3 percent in four early-state or national polls. (So far, [just five candidates have hit the threshold](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/democratic-debate-lineup.html?module=inline), and three more are on the cusp.)

It is not unheard-of for candidates polling in the single digits to eventually seize the nomination. In fall 2003, Senator John Kerry often polled in the single digits, [receiving as low as 4 percent](https://www.pollingreport.com/wh04dem.htm) in one nationwide CBS News poll; in the same survey, Senator John Edwards garnered only 2 percent. Mr. Kerry went on to become the Democratic nominee, and he chose Mr. Edwards as his running mate.

But Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster who worked on Howard Dean’s presidential campaign in 2004, noted that none of today’s single-digit candidates are polling as strongly in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early voting states as Mr. Kerry or Mr. Edwards were around the same time in 2003.

“I think the vast majority of primary voters are now realizing there’s only one of two or three possible winners,” Mr. Maslin said. “They have said to the vast majority of folks who are 3 percent or lower, ‘Thanks but no thanks.’”

As for the upcoming debate, he said, “Most of the Democratic primary voters would probably rather this be the last time you have that many people on the stage.”

“In Gabbard’s instance, three of her four qualifying polls have been in Iowa and New Hampshire, where she’s simply spent a lot of money on billboards to get her face and name out there,” he said. “Tom Steyer has quite literally bought himself name recognition in those early states, with online and TV advertising.”

&gt;Ranking Member Sessions and the minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee requested from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service (CRS) an overview of cumulative means-tested federal welfare spending in the United States in the most recent year for which data is available (fiscal year 2011). The results are staggering. **CRS identified 83 overlapping federal welfare programs that together represented the single largest budget item in 2011—more than the nation spends on Social Security, Medicare, or national defense. The total amount spent on these 80-plus federal welfare programs amounts to roughly $1.03 trillion. Importantly, these figures solely refer to means-tested welfare benefits.** They exclude entitlement programs to which people contribute (e.g., Social Security and Medicare).

Do we really need 83 welfare programs? Anyway, UBI would already be expensive enough.

&gt;UBI is great but we still need a social safety net.

UBI would effectively be a safety net with a ladder attached (because benefits wouldn't just suddenly cut off). I'm pretty sure $12,000 a year is above the poverty line, and while it won't be at all comfortable living on $1000 a month, it still fulfills the requirement of a ""safety net"": most people will be able to survive on it, and the few that don't can get extra assistance from state-specific (non-federal) welfare programs, private charity, or some sort of rehabilitation or mental assistance programs (for problems with excessive spending or addictions).

&gt; 
&gt; **OPINION**: New Zealand has five political parties in Parliament ranging from the far Left to the far Right. That’s the official version, anyway. If you take a look at the allegedly far Right one, while it's tinder dry on economic issues and contains a few gun nuts on its list, ACT indulges in little of the anti-immigrant rhetoric used by far-Right parties in places like Germany.
&gt; 
&gt;  You have to travel all the way into the centre to NZ First to find a party with a strong history of anti-immigrant sentiment – and even then its actions are far less than its words. Go a bit further Left and you will find the party that published ‘'Chinese’' names to demonstrate supposed foreign ownership of Auckland houses.
&gt; 
&gt;  But what about issues like economics and taxation? I’m not sure there’s that much difference there, either. The economic policies of a real far-Left party – like France’s Left Party led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon, with its 100 per cent income tax on earnings over €360,000 a year – would make James Shaw quake in his Hush Puppies.

&gt;  Our five parties have an unspoken consensus that corporate tax must stay low, that indirect taxes must rise and direct taxes must fall, that our crippling – for the poor – GST rate of 15 per cent must remain, and that corporate tax be modest. There may well be merit in some of these ideas, especially for those of us who remember Muldoon running the economy like a Polish shipyard, but it’s interesting that in global terms, our five little parties aren’t all that different.

&gt; 
&gt;  There is an unspoken, and sometimes spoken, feeling among many New Zealanders that those on benefits are lazy and wholly responsible for their plight. Many Kiwis feel outraged when they see beneficiaries having children or eating fast food. This outrage is not limited to National supporters, whose former leader John Key said beneficiaries made ‘'bad choices'’, but former Labour leaders and supporters as well.
&gt; 
&gt;  Now that some airline pilots, restaurant owners, travel agency employees and other ‘'hard-working New Zealanders’' are among the unemployed thanks to the Covid-19 crisis, have Kiwis softened their punitive stance and accepted that some people become beneficiaries through no fault of their own?

&gt;  So when we look at the Greens' ‘'far Left’' wealth tax, we have to remember that it is a slightly Left-of-centre party big on the environment and with the Right-wing ‘'realist'’ faction of the party firmly in control.
&gt; 
&gt;  To pay the Greens' wealth tax you have to own an asset worth more than a million dollars. Even then you only pay a small amount of tax based on the amount over a million. So all those residents of leafy Wellington suburbs, mine included, can relax – especially if you co-own a house. Even if you own a million-dollar house and a million-dollar company, you’ll more likely be paying your accountant more per year than the wealth tax.
&gt; 
&gt;  So what’s this maligned tax to pay for? A universal basic income of $325 a week. For many of us, living on $325 a week would be incredibly difficult. It’s hardly largesse. But already, there are howls of anti-socialist outrage not seen since [Jim Anderton suggested a Kiwi-owned state bank might be a good idea](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/5733182/Andertons-persistence-led-to-Kiwibank) – an idea that now even the National Party supports.

&gt; 
&gt;  Though it’s about as potent as a shandy in global terms, the wealth tax will be good news for the Greens. It’s a tangible way to start to redistribute wealth and will appeal to Labour’s Left who might support the Greens in order to guarantee they pass the 5 per cent threshold.
&gt; 
&gt;  Though the prime minister doubts that the tax will earn as much as the Greens said it will – and I suspect she has a point – the Greens' policy is also good news for Labour.
&gt; 
&gt;  Should it be re-elected, Labour can come up with a wishy-washy centrist scheme to address child poverty and inequality and when there are howls of outrage from the anti-beneficiary Right, Labour can say, ‘'it’s very moderate – nowhere as radical as what the Greens were proposing"".

They started again in the 40s 1.5% to 2.5% and stop around 1950. Most say the economy didn’t truly recover until after the war because of all the printing. From 50 to 08 it averaged about .5%

In the 10s we got to 3.5% and it fluctuated a little around 2011 to 2% before coming back up to 3%. Money growth (%GDP Ann.) was actually negative around 2015. I’m afraid we are not even close to where we need to be.

Spouting off countries?  How about direct examples of countries who have opened up the printing presses and magically printed money to disastrous consequences.  Throw in Argentina too.

Attempting to monetize debt is stupid.  Yes, the US is stupid for doing it.  Living beyond ones means is stupid.  Massive debt is always calamitous.  Rack up tons of student debt and not pay it and see what happens.  The concept is the same.  Eventually, someone is going to want their money back.

Pessimistic boomer-like way of thinking?  lmao.  It is reality.  Instead of the government taking the money, and then taking its cut to administer the distribution of the money.  Essentially, watering down the money so there is less of it.  Just let the people keep their money.  Here we are at the core of the matter with UBI.  It is just a wealth redistribution scheme with the government taking its cut.  Wealth redistribution is entirely communist and has zero to do with capitalism.

Failure policies designed to increase the size of government and weaken the power of the people.

No this is exactly the problem UBI solves vs. our existing welfare schemes.

Ok TIL that every modern country is communist.

Again, you are factually incorrect here. Communism is a fundamentally different system from capitalism. If you do not comprehend this, then go read up on the differences between capitalism and communism before spouting off nonsense.

&gt;Yep, Venezuela. How about Zimbabwea? The old Soviet Union? North Korea?

Do you consider spouting off random countries some kind of argument?

&gt;All the other countries with debt are living beyond their means with no hope of ever paying it back.

Debt denominated in one's own currency that one has the printing presses to is not the calamity people think actually.

I mean, we said the *exact* same thing in the 60s.

&gt;For example, imagine if you could automate trucking. That would be millions of jobs freed up, and people could go into nursing/caring for older people. The wealth will still be there, we just won't need to pay truck drivers anymore. 

Thats not how things work, though. If the economy isnt reliant on truck drivers anymore, automation will likely become significantly cheaper compared to the current landscape. Thus, prices will fall in an attempt to gain control of the market, leading to more demand. This in turn drives up production as well as retail, which requires workers.

Advances in the economy rarely just free up all the workers. Instead, new jobs are created. There would certainly be a few million that leave their sector entirely (mostly due to not being qualified for different positions), but there is no chance that we will need 30% less labour in 40 years. 

Theres also this trend with more and more people working fewer hours, so we lose even more labour here. We cannot compensate 35-40%, immigration will be necessary for sure.

&gt;We will need to introduce basic income/expansive welfare in order to bridge the gaps, and the transition period will be somewhat rough while these balances and issues are sorted out, but I am optimistic. The trends are clear. 

Where? In Germany, the amount of hours of work required to sustain its *current* economy decreases by only 0.08% per year. We would need some insane amount of innovation (that mustnt lead to additional labour requirements elsewhere) to offset 1,48 births per woman.","- Automation and jobs

No.

Wages should be relative to the income/production generated. In some companies it does work like that. There's a car factory near where I live where wages are like 2-3x the average wage in the entire country for people who do pretty easy assembly jobs (basically helping the machines and pushing a button sometimes) because of how profitable and highly automated the factory is.

But in many other cases, the gains indeed are just funelled to the top of the hierarchy while the workers get less because their jobs are ""easy"". Lately I seriously think we are entering some automation dystopia where not simply the ""means of production"" owners but the ""machine owners"" will be controlling extreme amounts of wealth as most people will be jobless and income-less.

Combined with the push to abolish the welfare state and lower the taxes for the wealthy, that means there won't even be a social safety net, let alone something like UBI.

Production may then decrease because there will be fewer buyers, and it may simply end up serving the wealthy elites rather than the ""old capitalism"" idea of large companies generating wealth because they serve the entire society.","Labor wages and work conditions, Automation and jobs, Taxes.",fxo41kj,"What if the automation means the work they’re doing is way easier?

486,"Hello fellow redditors,
I am from Germany and I'm a huge fan of the UBI concept. But before telling you why, I want to give you some basic information on the current German System. I don't know a lot of how things in the US work so I cannot relate to that, so I hope you can help me out with that. Here it's basically like this:
If you work, you pay taxes (surprise). tax rate is higher for higher incomes, starting at 0 for incomes below 450€ and peaking at about 45%. We have some basic income model already which is called Hartz 4. But unlike UBI it's not unconditional but only given to those that are unemployed and do not have any savings to live from. What you get as a single is about 750-800€ depending on where you live (it's a little higher in wealthier areas because the rent is higher). Hartz 4 is also given to those that make less than they would have if they were unemployed.

let's get to the question what I prefer UBI over our current system. I want to talk about 2 simple situations to show what I dislike about the current system.
1. let's assume i get a job offer for a 25h/week job paid about 10€/h (minimum wage is about 9€/h, so 10 is not too bad at all) this would give me about 1000€ per month. You pay 20% taxes on that so after taxes you have about 800€ which is not much more than you would get if you would not work at all.
2. let's assume 2 people, Alfred and Bruno working in the same position for the same company. A has a very humble lifestyle and saves a huge amount of his income. B wastes all his money and does not have any savings. now A and B loose their job at the same time. What the German system does now is checking how much A and B saved and they'll notice A got enough money to survive without gov support, so only B will receive Hartz 4 until A spend all his savings.

In the next paragraph I want to talk about how a system should work imo.
first of all every income should be taxed with the same rate. A certain percentage of the overall tax amount would be given out to the people equally. This means it would not be 1000€/1000$ per month but if the economy of the country gets stronger and the average income rises the UBI would also rise.

Let's now assume example numbers for the system.
let's say the tax rate is set to 50% and 40% of the taxes will go to the UBI. Applying these numbers would create a UBI of about 800-1000€ per month in Germany. if we apply those numbers on the examples from before it solves the issues the current system has:
1. because I get the UBI unconditionally every Euro I earn will give me 50ct that actually get into my pocket, no matter how much I made before. so working in a job that pays me 1000€/month will give me 500€ more than I would have if I wasn't working at all
2. because UBI is not only given to those who don't have savings to live from A would still have his savings and saving money actually paid off after all.

Of course the system has its disadvantages. For example people with higher incomes would have to pay more taxes overall. There is no system that will benefit everyone, but to me the system I think of is much more fair than the current one and I think everyone will feel like them agreeing on a job and working actually pays off.

Finally I want to talk about the 2 major arguments people bring up against an UBI.
1. ""people will get lazy and nobody will work""
-I don't believe this to happen because in the system we currently have in Germany you could also be lazy and stop working. Today there are implemented some mechanics that are made to force people to try to get a job, for example if you don't apply for a certain amount of jobs within a certain period of time Hartz 4 will be cut. But after all they will never cut it to 0 and you will always get enough to survive. On top of this if you do bad enough in the job interviews you will. never be employed if you really don't want to.
2. ""how can a UBI be paid""
-Ofc there will be someone who has to pay for it. As I said before there is no system that everyone benefits from. But the ones that would pay more. are ppl that have above average incomes and imo it will hurt those less than the poorer people. will benefit from it.

Thank you for reading my answer to the end. I hope my English was not too bad for you to get my points but I saw this post and since I think about UBI a lot I felt giving my opinion might gets some support for the system.

 ""There is no question that when we have today more people living in poverty than at any time in American history and when millions of families are struggling day by day just to keep their heads above water, we need to move aggressively to protect the dignity and well being of the least among us. Tragically, with cuts in food stamps, unemployment compensation and other important benefits, we are moving in exactly the wrong direction. There are a number of ways by which we can make sure that every man, woman and child in our country has at least a minimum standard of living and that is certainly something that must be explored.”

I have been keeping track ever since of the times you have been asked about UBI, and over time you appeared to become friendlier and friendlier to the idea, even mentioning the idea independently of even being asked a question about it. That is until April 7th of this year where you responded to an audience member asking about UBI that JG is a better alternative.

With that said, my question to you is this:

Why do you believe that a job guarantee and unconditional basic income are alternatives that are somehow two ways of accomplishing the same goal instead of two policies with different goals that could benefit each other?

A job guarantee will need to differentiate between the ""fit to work"" and ""unfit to work"", where those able to work can accept employment, and those unable to work, get what exactly? Do they get disability income that is as large as the JG income? Must they prove they are sufficiently disabled? What if they can't prove they are sufficiently disabled?

Are you aware that 4 out of 5 people with a disability in this country get zero assistance and are forced to compete with the fully-abled in labor markets? Are you also aware that on average those looking to prove they are disabled wait for 2 years, and that the list is a million people long? Don't you feel that an unconditional basic income floor of say $1,000 per month would be really useful to everyone with a disability, because they will have that amount unconditionally? It's a lot easier to wait 2 years for an extra $500/mo if you have $1,000/mo than it is to wait 2 years for $1500/mo with $0/mo.

Are you also aware that 13 million people in poverty are entirely disconnected from our safety net programs? A UBI would reach every single one of those 13 million people, lifting all of them to the poverty line as a new starting point, where anything earned would lift them further out of poverty. Do you feel those 13 million people deserve to live in poverty unless they accept a government job?

Are you also not concerned at all about a job guarantee devolving into workfare? Throughout history, when a program says ""work for your welfare"", people have no choice but to work doing anything. This lack of choice, besides being incredibly coercive, lowers wages. If workers are being forced to work, then anyone doing that work for more than that is competing against them. This hurts bargaining power. As long as you can't refuse to work, you have no bargaining power.

UBI provides everyone with the power to say no, and thus bargaining power. It makes every job voluntary, and wages can be negotiated on a more equal footing between employee and employer.

UBI also boosts incomes the equivalent of a $6/hr wage hike for those working 40 hours, and $12/hr wage hike for those working 20 hours. Do you believe a worker is better off going from $13/hr to a $15/hr minimum wage than that same worker is going from $13/hr to the equivalent of $19/hr?

Do you believe that the circumstances of a higher-paid worker earning $20/hr is improved by the offer of a $15/hr guaranteed job or a $15/hr minimum wage? Obviously not, right? Especially if the JG puts downward pressure on their wage due to competition, right? So why would you be against a UBI boosting that person's income to the equivalent of $26/hr?

I think UBI should be seen as a foundational floor. Everyone in society could start above the poverty line instead of far below it. This would abolish poverty just as MLK had envisioned in his final years. Minimum wage jobs and guaranteed jobs could then provide additional income so that people could more easily put distance between themselves and the poverty line, improving their lives. The entire country would feel economic security unconditionally. People would feel more financially stable and less stressed. People would be healthier, which would mean we'd spend less on Medicare for All, and people would be able to focus on their educations more, meaning that the money we put into public education would go further and lead to better outcomes.

I believe in your ability to see the importance of UBI as something we need entirely independently of any minimum wage hike or job guarantee or universal health care or universal college. I don't know why you decided to reverse course on UBI, but I do hope you reverse course again, and I have faith you will as the idea  only continues to gain popularity.

Additionally, it doesn't disincentivize working as welfare does (the Welfare Cliff).  But if you're going to have a UBI, then eliminate the minimum wage.  You can't make an argument for a ""livable"" wage if that's covered with a UBI.

The other reason I've swung to being in favor the UBI is that automation and AI are going to eliminate jobs altogether.  This isn't a case of buggy whip manufacturers going out of business and jobs going to manufacturing.  Transportation is a perfect example.   Once long-haul trucking is automated, millions of jobs dependent upon that industry are gone.  That will just be the start.  

The problem would be cost.  Say the UBI replaces Welfare, food stamps, Social Security, etc.  Each US citizen 18+ receives $25k.  That's $6 trillion dollars a year.  Say 1/3 comes back as taxes making it $4 trillion dollars a year (or you pay it out as non-taxable income).  That's still $4 trillion dollars a year.   That's more than the   tax revenues for 2017.  That's not really workable.

So you shrink the numbers.  There are 67 million people on government assistance in the US.  I'm going to say half of that number is adults.  You have 61 million people collection Social Security.  Just to make the numbers rounded, let's say 100 million people would receive UBI.  That's $1.6 trillion (if you calculate they receive the money tax free).  That's a more workable number.

If people have more money in their pocket they tend to spend more (frivolously or not) not save more. Isn't that one of the arguments for UBI even, that it will increase spending and boost the economy?

I'm by no means an expert on any subject (although I'm am trying to learn more about this in particular) but here are my thoughts on it. A few things just seem inevitable to me, automation WILL replace more and more jobs as it gets more advanced and with the current model of global economy it will be impossible to just create enough jobs exclusively for humans. Although many first world nations seem tolerant of poverty and destitution for third world nations, automation is going to start to bring these things into first world countries. And that simply isn't a stable situation for any country or government. These days it seems like the top priority for a government is to stay the government and that doesn't happen when millions of people don't have a job and can't pay taxes.

IIRC Finland is doing a UBI trial run of sort and it recently started although I don't know all of the details. I feel like there are two ways to effectively have a UBI. You could have a welfare type of system where citizens receive enough money to provide the necessities for your family. OR since automation is going to initially replace manual labor and service type jobs some things are just provides for free. If you need clothes you just go to a clothing store (primarily or entirely run by robots/AI/what-have-you) and pick out what you ne**e**d (which has been made in an autonomous factory likely with resources harvest or synthesized autonomously) and you don't have to pay for it.

There's no arguing that there isn't enough money in the world for everyone to have at the very least bare necessities. Yes, it's someone else's. Yes, they may have worked very hard for it. But honestly how much money does one person or family really need? I'm not saying it's fair either, because it isn't. But does that make it any less necessary? Is it fair for someone to just BE BORN into a community with no clean water, scarce food, and no health care? What about into a community primarily employed by some large US company utilizing cheap/child labor?

Science is advancing at an incredible rate, things we thought impossible a century ago are happening today. But eventually we either have to be willing to live in some sort of post-apocalyptic-type sci-fi world where a minuscule percentage of people live in a luxurious utopia and everyone else lives in squalor OR we can try and figure out something that works for the *species* and the *planet*.

""Well what if people are provided with everything they need and they just sit around and sponge off the government?"" The biggest issue with the current welfare system is that it helps provide money/food/housing but doesn't provide a purpose. It's difficult and disheartening to be receiving aid, working a menial job, and still not see a way out. Want a better job? You need a degree. Want a degree? You have to go into debt to get one. Don't want to get into debt? Get a better job so you can save to go to school. Want a better job? Oh wait.

What if school was free. You could go learn about all the things that interest you. You could contribute to society. Maybe you could figure out the piece to some scientific puzzle. ""School can't be free, someone has to pay for it."" Well what if as you kept learning more you offered your newfound knowledge to teach people who know less? And since you are provided food/housing/clothes/education/healthcare, it's no big deal because your job is to learn. And learning and teaching go hand in hand.

I've already been writing this for an hour (on mobile) and I feel like I could write forever about the potential our species has, but I'll stop now. My point is that bigs things are going to happen faster than we think and there are going to be big changes to the world as we know it.

Even when we try to address these issues with things like upskilling, the results are not exactly stellar.

Considering that, think about the future of machine learning, automation, and IT.  We have millions and millions of workers whose jobs will go away, many of them low-wage or entry-level.  Yang cited truck drivers (yes, we'll have self-driving semis), but these changes will displace everyone from McDonald's workers (this is happening now) to scientists.  Consider my comments on how automation affected specific industries that tended to be clustered in Rust Belt cities, but understand that this new wave of displacement isn't clustered. This new wave of tech is and will continue to affect every single region, state, and community and almost every single industry.  A gigantic chunk of our workers will not only be unemployed-- they will be unemployable.

You won't see this take over in 2019, 2020, or 2021.  But in 10-20 years, technology displacing labor will be a major challenge to overcome.  And unlike in the past, new jobs won't emerge in time, because tech is moving so, so fast.

I think we've converged to the same solution - a basic job rather than a basic income. But that's not a UBI since it's not universal - the only people who receive it are those who do the work.

The sense in which there is an permanent infinite shortfall of work has nothing to do with labour shortage. There is a bunch of work with X amount of value , and if X is below a nartural or artificial baseline wage, it is not going to get done.

And here's some wiki excerpts re: the term Welfare Queen

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_queen?wprov=sfsi1

&gt; The term was coined in 1974, either by George Bliss of the Chicago Tribune in his articles about Linda Taylor, or by Jet Magazine.[6] Neither publication credits the other in their ""Welfare Queen"" stories of that year. Taylor was ultimately charged with committing $8,000 in fraud and having four aliases.[7] She was convicted of illegally obtaining 23 welfare checks using two aliases and was sentenced to two to six years in prison.[8][9] During the same decade, Taylor was additionally investigated for murder, kidnapping, and baby trafficking.[10] Stories of her activities were used by Ronald Reagan, starting with his 1976 presidential campaign, to illustrate his criticisms of social programs in the United States.[11]

&gt; The media's image of poverty shifted from focusing on the plight of white Appalachian farmers and on the factory closings in the 1960s to a more racially divisive and negative image of poor blacks in urban areas. All of this, according to political scientist Martin Gilens, led to the American public dramatically overestimating the percentage of African-Americans in poverty.[12] By 1973, in magazine pictures depicting welfare recipients, 75% featured African Americans even though African Americans made up only 35% of welfare recipients and only 12.8% of the US population.[12] In 2016, African Americans made up 39.6% of welfare recipients, and, in 2015, African Americans made up 13.3% of the United States population.[citation needed] However, in a study conducted by Van Doorn he suggested the media repeatedly shows a relationship between lazy, black, and poor suggesting why some Americans are opposed to welfare programs.[citation needed]

589,"&gt; Most, if not all, of the data suggests that the freer, healthier, and wealthier a population becomes, the less new people they tend to make. The population tends to keep itself in check when standards of living get better.

I've started to wonder about that one. It seems that as people view children as negatively affecting their lifestyle they want to have less. That goes hand in hand with rising standards of living as you say. However I wonder if that trend would continue if we had mass joblessness and basic income. Then people would have more time on their hands to raise children and with the basic income would not feel the financial disincentives that come with having children today. 

In other words people would be less negatively affected by having children than today in such a system and thus might start having more.
",Automation and jobs.,cgjqsrv,"That seems incredibly unlikely for a whole lot of reasons.

1) Most, if not all, of the data suggests that the freer, healthier, and wealthier a population becomes, the less new people they tend to make. The population tends to keep itself in check when standards of living get better.

2) There's plenty of space out in space. We are not confined to this tiny rock.

3) Trends in technology suggest, at least to me, that we are very likely to leave biology behind entirely just as soon as we get the chance. Eugenics is basically meaningless when you're talking about non-biological life. Population, too, for that matter.

4) A basic income is very likely to be a temporary, transitional policy. As we become more interconnected and more intelligent, economic systems and governments will probably be replaced by decentralized and more democratized consensus based resource allocation systems. Something similar to a resource-based economy (though maybe not specifically that) will probably be an emergent property of coming technologies. Money is becoming obsolete, or at the very least capitalism is.

5) Eugenics requires strict authoritarian control, otherwise it's just simple natural selection. Those types of regimes appear to be losing power pretty rapidly nowadays.

The world is becoming less and less centralized, which has a lot to do with all the problems the global economy and current governments have been facing recently. That's only going to start happening more and more from now on.

So, I wouldn't worry about this kind of thing. There are plenty of problems we're going to face in the next few decades, but I highly doubt eugenics is going to be one of them.

- All the anti-capitalist stuff associated with it. UBI depends on people continuing to work to fund it. Yet a lot of the messaging surrounding UBI revolves the idea that people dropping out of the labour force is a worthwhile end unto itself.

President Ivanka Trump had just met Putin, President of Eurasia, and agreed on tougher measures against Quadlife. The IFAQ had just launched a new SpaceForce DeathStar, capable of tracking Quadlifers by measuring the length of DNA chromosomes telomeres. 


""Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Annual Quadlifers Convention, please sit down"", said Jack, walking into a conference room full of 10-year-olds. It hasn't been long since he started this society. He didn't know whether it was going to help Quadlifers around the world or put them in more danger, he just knew he had to do it. 


""Everyone wants us dead, they want to hide the truth. We are not fighting for our lives, we are fighting for humankind"" said Jack. Everyone knew what he was talking about. The scars on his face were still fresh, it's only been a few days since the attempt on his life. ""We have within our hands a great power, but with it comes an even greater responsibility. Only we can save humankind from our imminent fate"" said Jack. The kids knew he was right, or at least, they hoped. 


It's been exactly ten years since he started this experiment. He's always known he was different, special, almost ""super-human"". Ever since he was a kid, he's always had a special relationship with ""Time"". He always felt like time moved slower for him than for other people. He could function perfectly on only a couple of hours of sleep at night. He would finish an exam paper before anybody else. His parents always told him he ""speaks too fast"", and that he should ""try to slow down a little"". Yeah, and his watch, this was the weirdest one. His watch always seemed to go faster than other watches, much faster. Everyone thought it was just a mechanical error, except Jack. He liked the idea, he felt like ""Time"" was his friend. His ""Ally"". That he could ""wield time"". He didn't think any of it was connected, until his 10th birthday, the day he met Jessica. At the bakery, Jack was with his father picking up the birthday cake, that's when he saw a girl having a fight with the baker about her cake not being ready on time, with the baker trying to explain to her that her watch is broken.

603,"&gt;  A lot of people seem to be just be opposed to him, because he talks about race and IQ. In a lot of discussions here, the policies aren't even mentioned.

Yeah, but unlike Sam, those other people apparently realize on some level that there is an immensely important political subtext to discussions about race and IQ, and Murray's policy views confirm that this subtext exists and cannot be left unaddressed. These people may be making a mistake when they attack science rather than policy, but they are *appropriately apprehensive* about the topic, and it is actually Sam who is making the much more serious mistake of thinking that there is no danger as long as one is sufficient rational and well-meaning. As it turns out, the eugenics and social Darwinist movements of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were quite well meaning and championed by even the most prestigious scientific institutions, but this did not avert their utterly disastrous effects on vulnerable people and communities. ""Let science dictate policy"" may sound awesome, but it has been a veritable minefield in the past, and Sam is rightly receiving criticism for his irresponsible, overly self-confident handling of the issue. This is not to say we *shouldn't* use science to create policy. It's just that it evidently requires an enormous amount of care, humility, and expertise, which is exactly the opposite of how I would characterize Sam's approach.

&gt; And there Sam was rightfully upset about the witch hunt for simply discussing the data. Of course, data can be incorrect, but it should still be possible to discuss it until that's proven.

I disagree. The conclusions any non-expert will draw from the data will be childishly simplistic compared to the real system being studied. Science is hard, and that's why we have professional scientists who spend their whole professional lives analyzing just a narrow set of issues. A corollary to this is that experts should be careful about discussing data publicly. Doing so does not educate, it only serves to allow non-experts to choose which conclusions they find most appealing. 

&gt; That said, currently giving them more money is not just about incentives. It's also about allowing them to expand and invest more, so they can have an even bigger positive impact on the world: more jobs, new creations (Of course that doesn't always happen.)

I mean, it's not like we're giving them money to go build schools or something. They're just sucking that money out of the working class, and we're all just hoping that they'll use it for something that happens to benefit the average person. It's kind of like saying, ""Oh, I'm so glad all our crops go to the local lord. Now he can build a bigger army to defend us peasants."" It's party true, but sort of ignores the completely unnecessary level of inequality involved. And also the fact that most of that money is not going to be used for the benefit of the peasants. The lord will simply use the minimum amount of money necessary to maintain the peasantry, to prevent them from starving or being killed, so that he can continue to benefit from their labor. The fact that the peasants receive some benefits from the system does not make the system fair or equal.

&gt; Of course, every company wants to automate as much as possible to save money, but that's a good thing. We don't want to do repetitive, boring jobs.

Ah, this is an interesting one. Automation has clearly increased the productivity of our economy enormously. So why do we not have like a 20-hour work week by now? Instead, wages are lower and unemployment is higher. The answer is that market forces alone will not create a utopia for the working class, they will create what they have always created: wage slavery. Read about the Gilded Age, the robber barons, and the labor movements of the 19th and early 20th centuries.

&gt; Again, I fully agree there are a lot of market failures, but I'm not sure how to improve the system. Do you have ideas?

We need a system that gives the average person more control over the economy, so that they can defend their economic interests. The current system is predatory, and puts the average person at the mercy of the wealthy. 

&gt; I think something that would help a lot is a basic income as suggested by Andrew Yang and others. Getting rid of existing welfare systems alone would save a ton of money that can be used to finance the UBI, and then nobody would need to be scared of losing their job.

If you give people some money, the current system would allow landlords and businesses to simply take that money. People don't just need money, they need the means to protect that money from predation by market forces.","- Data analysis and research

It can still be a mistake of just having missed the problems of the suggested social policies while reading the book. 

I could be wrong, but to me it definitely seemed like he was de-platformed for just talking about race and IQ.. and a lot of people here don't even talk about the policy suggestions. 

If that's indeed the case, Sam was rightfully upset about the witch hunt (for simply discussing the data). Of course, data can be incorrect, but it should still be possible to discuss it until that's proven.

Either way, I agree that it appears like Sam messed up here. I'm not sure about the degree though.

&gt; do they actually deserve more? Haven't they just gotten lucky?

Yeah, they got lucky. Maybe ""deserve"" was the wrong word.

&gt; There are plenty of incentives other than absurd amounts wealth though. In fact, rewarding people with wealth is probably rewarding exactly the wrong types of people

That's true. (And IIRC studies have shown that monetary incentives make people working on creative tasks perform worse.) I'm completely open for alternative systems of incentives. 

That said, currently giving them more money is not just about incentives. It's also about allowing them to expand and invest more, so they can have an even bigger positive impact on the world: more jobs, new creations (Of course that doesn't always happen.)


&gt; I also somewhat disagree that this system is rewarding people for creating inventions or jobs. More often than not, the actual inventors get ripped off and the jobs that are ""created"" are often not the best use of that labor.

I mean, it's not 1 to 1, but when your company is expanding it usually will need more employees to get stuff done.

Of course, every company wants to automate as much as possible to save money, but that's a good thing. We don't want to do repetitive, boring jobs. 

&gt; For example, do we really need another consumer electronics company? Wouldn't it be better to use that labor to, say, build some freaking infrastructure in this deteriorating country? Or try to make sure people have enough to eat?

From what I can tell, so far your post contained useful reminders, misinterpretations of what I meant to communicate as well as some strategic aspects to how to go about furthering the struggle for more leftist power in the world.

But I have debated the content: I have repeated multiple times that UBI is a capitalist solution for capitalist problems, and referenced meaningful academics and sources at least as powerful as yours.

UBI is not about increasing use-values. It is about increasing exchange-value. That is not a matter of perspective. Money cannot be used except as a means of exchange for something that can be used – you can't eat money, live in it, etc. You cannot *use* it, it can only be *exchanged* for something that can be used. I am saying instead of giving people more stuff to exchange for things they can use (which is what UBI is, giving people more money) we ought to be delivering to people use values *directly*. UBI does not do that, it is not conceived to do that, it is conceived as a way of maintaining effective demand in a capitalist economy. It is pushed by Silicon Valley because they are the ones who will benefit the most from it, not the poor who need it.",Taxonomy: Economic systems.,e4m398u,"&gt; You talk about ""emancipation."" But free market people talk about ""emancipating"" the market, and the similar rhetoric is not something you cannot simply dismiss. 

I wasn't even aware that someone would say something as ridiculous as 'emancipating the market', but alright. I happen to have looked into a number of third world related publications where emancipation is used to exclusively refer to people. Maybe it helps to keep in mind that UBI supporters will use the word in that context more often than not.

&gt; You are implicated in the political notions implied by this rhetoric, and just saying ""well, they abused it"" is bullshit. How do you know the UBI people aren't abusing it?

By assessing the different policies for their merits. I do try to practice scrutiny and can only recommend it!

&gt; We will not solve the problems of capitalism within capitalism, and the problems of mass impoverishment are a problem of capitalism.

Goes without saying, agreed.

&gt; UBI ... is narrow and individualistic, playing into the neoliberal ideas about how ""there is no such thing as society, only individuals""

The opposite is the case as far as I understand and meant to communicate. Care to make a case? To re-iterate on my perspective: 

An income that is neither behavior tested nor wealth tested, that is enough to subsist and participate in society with dignity, without bureaucracies to assess one's market income needlessly, a policy like that enables people to form connections within a broad range of communities, while e.g. a JG risks a narrowing of the social landscape one gets to witness (while being due every bit of scrutiny that a UBI is due as well).

Not saying either concept would necessarily do any of that, however. Feel free to provide some rationale for your view beyond, ""well, gotta be a real suspicious person in this day and age; also I don't like the words you use because people of problematic ideologies caricatured em at times for ill effects"". Fair points by the way.

What stops us from re-defining words as well? Or even better, what stops us from restoring the meanings of given words?

I'd also say that they weren't so successful with unhinging civil rights only due to the way they use words. Rather, it's the whole package that is aimed at de-legitimizing the claims of **individuals** to being **dignified members of society**.


&gt; The latter is a collective right that emphasizes popular access to use-values rather than exchange-values. 

So is a UBI, exactly. As I tried to imply earlier, workers who do not require an income can do work more often as a matter of the use value they get out of doing it, and for the sake of delivering a use value to another. It is a likely human behavior to reduce emphasis on exchange value and increase emphasis on use value, in their interactions, given the opportunities.

&gt; We need to emphasize collective rights, not individual freedoms. We have had 40 years of that line,

Be aware that using words in a way that is caricatured by neoliberals isn't a great idea, either. In reality, also individual rights have seen an unprecedented assault over the past 40 years.

&gt;  and it has led to the considerable reregulation of society according to ""market rationality.""

Indeed, we've seen a faith based economic model that focuses on stripping individuals as well as communities of their rights, appealing to the market as an entity supposedly above morality, supposedly an impartial arbitrator of who deserves what. A belief that is anti-democratic and anti-rights, be they individual or collective.

&gt; We ought to be deeply suspicious of any political reasoning that makes appeals to ""freedom,"" especially in an American context.

Nothing wrong with being suspicious. As much as appeals to freedom from the right are hollow, focusing on negative freedom, that is the freedom to be left alone doing whatever. While positive freedoms are freedoms that depend on a social context. Might help to distinguish intentions.

&gt; You are missing the reasoning behind my bringing that up. 

No harm in making your intentions a little more clear, then. :D

&gt; It has nothing to do with economics facts; it has to do with the kind of rhetoric and reasoning that has been used to defend neoliberalization.

That's how I see it as well, agreed! Of course the ideological attack rested on far more than just 'words'. You're aware of the campaigns attempting to frame some of the most vulnerable as basically sub-human? If we cannot reason for surfers to have a right to subsistence in dignity as well, our counter-offensive might have a hard time. It makes sense to attack the ideologies, as well as the words (mis-)used by neoliberals.

&gt; Now we have exactly the same reasoning being employed to defend something supposedly progressive.

So it makes sense to be suspicious, yup! It's a big problem in Europe with regard to JG-esque schemes as well. Always helps to look at intentions, how the models actually work and so on. Again I'm not huge on Yang's UBI proposal, though I am huge on practicing scrutiny.

&gt; You are yourself employing the same capitalist economic reasoning used by others to defend neoliberalization

&gt; appeals to freedom

And I feel no shame in defending the left vision of freedom that focuses on 'freedom to', not 'freedom from'. Positive freedom.

&gt; productivity

I'll take productivity as a byproduct, it is not a talking point for me. I'd prefer a UBI over an economy twice as productive as a measure of commodity production, if the gained productivity strips people of their capacity to chose who to work with, for who and how. I rather have people enjoy more use value.

&gt; and contributing to the community, etc.

Who is 'the' community? The global community? I'm not sure I made an appeal towards that (yet).

&gt; You also missed my point behind bringing up the Chicago School.

Interesting.

&gt; It was not an excuse for you to show off your grasp of economic jargon.

I meant to communicate that there's not much of a place for the Chicago school in economic theory that focuses on observation of reality, which 2008 made particularly clear. I'll try to stick to simple English if the jargon was too heavy. :)
 
&gt; Again, you and the UBI people are regurgitating bourgeois rhetoric to support something allegedly progressive

It is quite interesting how you try to frame what I said without attempting to debate the content specifically. From what I can tell, so far your post contained useful reminders, misinterpretations of what I meant to communicate as well as some strategic aspects to how to go about furthering the struggle for more leftist power in the world.

Feel free to inquire into any particular thing I said that struck you as 'bourgeois rhetoric', that isn't clearly no such thing by now, and I shall be looking into the foundations I depend on for informing those views of mine.

&gt; even though the people most vocally supporting the UBI are Silicon Valley CEOs, a point which you claim to not understand.

Think about it like this: I've been first made aware of the concept of a UBI due to a day nanny starting a petition on it some 9 years ago, while Silicon Valley was sleeping and while my own personal experience was characterized by an erosion of individual rights and social solidarity, which went alongside the introduction of punitive work services ~~for~~ to be done by the most vulnerable.

&gt; The solution is not to give people lots of money from the government. 

I'm all for reducing the emphasis on government currency creation monopoly, as much as I have concerns regarding the resilience of regional currencies in context with globally operating predatory investors. Either way we need to de-leverage private debt one way or another. Still is a good idea to build alternative modes of provisioning.

&gt; The solution is to allow greater access to use-values

That's the objective, not the solution, right? An objective we share.

612,"SS: In October of this year the linked website posted leaked information from a Liberal Party member outlining Canada's plans for Covid19 in 2021.  This was the first website to have this information, it would later be shared on other conspiracy pages and boards.

The outline for harsher lockdowns at the end of 2020 has already begun which will end by January 2021.  Q1 2021 - Universal basic income is next phase and there's mention of debt forgiveness for accepting the vaccine schedule.  

The lockdowns will eventually force the middle class and lower into debt poverty and the government (who caused the problem) offers a way out with free money if they accept the vaccine schedule.  **The vaccines aren't mandatory but if you want to survive you're going to have to take the [mark](https://www.kingjamesbible.me/Revelation-13-17/), i mean vaccine.**

&gt;  In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule

I want to provide you some very important information. I’m a committee member within the Liberal Party of Canada. I sit within several committee groups but the information I am providing is originating from the Strategic Planning committee (which is steered by the PMO).
I need to start off by saying that I’m not happy doing this but I have to. As a Canadian and more importantly as a parent who wants a better future not only for my children but for other children as well. The other reason I am doing this is because roughly 30% of the committee members are not pleased with the direction this will take Canada, but our opinions have been ignored and they plan on moving forward toward their goals. They have also made it very clear that nothing will stop the planned outcomes.

The road map and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows:
* Phase in secondary lock down restrictions on a rolling basis, starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward. Expected by November 2020.

* Rush the acquisition of (or construction of) isolation facilities across every province and territory. Expected by December 2020.

* Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID related deaths following the same growth curves. Expected by end of November 2020.

* Complete and total secondary lock down (much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions). Expected by end of December 2020 – early January 2021
________________________________________________________________________
* Reform and expansion of the unemployment program to be transitioned into the universal basic income program. Expected by Q1 2021.

* Projected COVID-19 mutation and/or co-infection with secondary virus (referred to as COVID-21) leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection. Expected by February 2021.

* Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical care facilities capacity. Expected Q1 – Q2 2021.

* Enhanced lock down restrictions (referred to as Third Lock Down) will be implemented. Full travel restrictions will be imposed (including inter-province and inter-city). Expected Q2 2021.

* Transitioning of individuals into the universal basic income program. Expected mid Q2 2021.

* Projected supply chain break downs, inventory shortages, large economic instability. Expected late Q2 2021.

* Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints. Restrict travel and movement. Provide logistical support to the area. Expected by Q3 2021.

Along with that provided road map the Strategic Planning committee was asked to design an effective way of transitioning Canadians to meet a unprecedented economic endeavor. One that would change the face of Canada and forever alter the lives of Canadians. What we were told was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on a international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief. 

This is how it works: the federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts (mortgages, loans, credit cards, etc) which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset program. **In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever. The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule,** which would provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living even under a full lock down (through the use of photo identification referred to as Canada’s HealthPass).

Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions, we were simply told “the World Debt Reset program will handle all of the details”. Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset program, or the HealthPass, or the vaccination schedule, and the answer we got was very troubling. Essentially we were told it was our duty to make sure we came up with a plan to ensure that would never happen. We were told it was in the individuals best interest to participate. When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer we were told that those who refused would first live under the lock down restrictions indefinitely. And that over a short period of time as more Canadians transitioned into the debt forgiveness program, the ones who refused to participate would be deemed a public safety risk and would be relocated into isolation facilities. Once in those facilities they would be given two options, participate in the debt forgiveness program and be released, or stay indefinitely in the isolation facility under the classification of a serious public health risk and have all their assets seized.

So as you can imagine after hearing all of this it turned into quite the heated discussion and escalated beyond anything I’ve ever witnessed before. In the end it was implied by the PMO that the whole agenda will move forward no matter who agrees with it or not. That it wont just be Canada but in fact all nations will have similar roadmaps and agendas. That we need to take advantage of the situations before us to promote change on a grander scale for the betterment of everyone. The members who were opposed and ones who brought up key issues that would arise from such a thing were completely ignored. Our opinions and concerns were ignored. We were simply told to just do it.

All I know is that I don’t like it and I think its going to place Canadians into a dark future.

616,"Paid maternity leave is like minimum wage; it doesn't help those who don't already have a job to begin with. Any official Catholic support for such things would have to be understood in the light of securing full employment (or a basic income regardless of employment) *first.*

Catholic social teaching, I'd imagine, would be more concerned with addressing this root inequality, not so much with securing extra privileges that apply only to those lucky enough to have a job in the first place.

Stay-at-home moms don't expect to get paid for twelve weeks following birth. But a two-income household can't bear to give up twelve weeks of the woman's pay for not working? Even though there are unemployed people who are desperate to find twelve weeks pay just for actually working. 

Can you imagine being someone who can't even find twelve weeks pay for actually doing work...and then hearing someone demand it for *not* working??

So again, Catholic social teaching would probably incline towards addressing these root issues (of unemployment or basic income for all), before trying to secure special privileges that apply only to the employed but not the unemployed.

It would also probably hint that married women's income should only ever be supplemental; that is to say, society should be structured such that households can survive comfortably on one income (like they used to) and that the mother could choose to be a full-time homemaker if she wanted.

626,"&gt; In many ways, I don't think that the primary recipients of welfare in any form are grateful for it

I see this as well, and UBI is a proposed solution to this problem in part, as I tried to imply with the whole 'trying to force people to their luck' thing. Welfare today has little to do with giving people who are in need. That's literally the last step in a sequence of actions that do not invoke anything close to gratitude. You can't evaluate a system by (one of) its intended purpose(s), you also have to evaluate the steps that are taken in the process.

&gt; As I understand it, UBI in all forms is funded via taxes

I'm personally quite fond of the concept of a demurrage, though I guess taxes are also an option. Raising taxes does not have to happen by use of violence, though. Say via the value added tax. Which is only raised on people who want to do business in any given society, taking into account any fees that might apply. (then again, as long as we don't have a UBI, you're kinda forced to sell your labor and with that, also sell stuff to people indirectly.)

Also not sure what you mean with social classes. Of course there'd be people with vastly different incomes. Though having a labor market that functions on basis of threat of starvation, and another labor market, that functions on the basis of monetary incentive is not something supportable from the perspective of a free market supporter such as me. You systematically remove opportunities to earn money via labor, if you consider threat of starvation as a valid replacement for monetary incentive to an appreciable height. Though of course the price finding process would still see income differences for different jobs, based on supply and demand, available labor and customers, even if we were to look in the direction of a more free market.

&gt; I absolutely agree, however isn't there likely a point of diminishing, and even negative returns to this? 

Certainly. Where the exact best ratios are I'm not sure, either. Also, a UBI doesn't automatically change wealth/income inequality (because people with more income security are willed to spend more rather than saving, to some extent, so you'd potentially get *greater* reflow of money to capital (greater than what was collected via intrusive or not so intrusive taxes), with a very modest UBI), though a UBI makes higher levels of wealth/income inequality more sustainable, I'm pretty sure. (that said, I'd still want to aim for some less income inequality than we have today.)

&gt; I feel that I'm clear about where you are coming from, but I'm not sure that you've internalized the difference between intent and outcome.

I have, and this is the reason I support the things I support, in this case. Even if it might seem counter intuitive to you. Don't worry, this is not uncommon. Feel free to contempate about your own intrinsic and extrinsic incentive structure and to further investigate what research has say. Or just put yourself into the shoes of the people you consider problematic. You might find that it's circumstancial rather than a problem with the people, for the most part. We have a system in place that doesn't rely very much on monetary incentive for a lot of people, but rather on the use of violence, to achieve productive societal participation. Not very inspiring, nor does it enable people very well to participate productively in society, given the limitations are rather prohibitive for when it comes to where the potential opportunities are.

Rather give people back the responsibilities they currently do not have to feel, if they just write x applications and take part in y course that doesn't benefit em, and spend an immense amount of mental effort z on working through the relevant offices and paperwork for their needs (while having to deal with underqualified, sometimes overworked, staff). Whoever put these things in place surely might have had good intentions, and a desire to increase labor that is available to the low wage sector too, but aside from the latter part, I don't see the intended outcomes materialize. (and it's surely not hard to make people available to the low wage sector, even if they have a UBI. Because they have a UBI. Makes matters easier for employers, compared to today's systems where some correspondence between welfare office and employer is needed for certain perks and matters. At least that's how it is where I live.)","- Non-UBI government welfare programs
- Taxes",d8wnjsr,"&gt;Sure, this [feel obligated to give back to the community] is part of what makes us human. Inspiring gratitute is one way to nurture it.

In many ways, I don't think that the primary recipients of welfare in any form are grateful for it, in fact, they are often the people the I hear the loudest complaining about it not being enough. I think that hearing ""please and thank you"" may actually go a long way towards making me feel better about giving my income to them, but honestly, the real solution to me is to give me a say in the values that they are taught. I feel that it's only moral to give me some of their time in compensation for my money, since I had to give up some of my time to earn the money.

&gt;You wouldn't have to do anything, there would be no need for guys with guns, no nothing.

As I understand it, UBI in all forms is funded via taxes, and so you still have social classes. If you're proposing getting rid of social classes, then what motivation will people have to do the hardest work. If I would get the same level of income from working as a store clerk VS working at my desk job, I would gladly take the store clerk job, which is the far easier and more rewarding job.

&gt;Still, keep in mind that if we increase the velocity of money, the increased economic activity can be a net benefit to you

I absolutely agree, however isn't there likely a point of diminishing, and even negative returns to this? It seems to me that once we pass the 80/20 rule, the overall capital output begins to wane, and the system as a whole begins to suffer... at the same time, I 100% agree that going beyond the 80/20 rule (as we right now, with to top 20% earning 86% of the wealth) is also bad. There seems to be a golden ratio of inequality that benefits the system as a whole.

I feel that I'm clear about where you are coming from, but I'm not sure that you've internalized the difference between intent and outcome. If when I make a wood carving, I intent for it to be something that adds value back to society, that doesn't necessarily make it so. The outcome, could in fact, be negative, especially if no one else wants my carving.

There are a few policy positions that I consider critical in terms of earning my support:

1) The Green New Deal (infrastructure, environmentalism, and jobs). We need to heal the planet and the economy. Why not do both at once?

2) A Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month for every American who pays taxes. People could afford their bills, and even have disposable income. It would increase the tax base and be good for businesses by providing more customers. Furthermore, more people will be able to start their own enterprises. Nixon agreed with it.

4) College for All; education is a human right.

- I think UBI would just be a treadmill; more and more taxes going into govt and right back out as cash to people. I don't see how it really adds any intelligence to the system. And rich people will see it as a purely redistributive system, more obvious than any other, making it less likely to survive politically than other types of safety-net programs.

Which will also cause prices to go up, reducing the buying power of a UBI below subsistence.  This will happen every time, 100% until we have new slaves (robotic ones that is). They will do work for so cheap that the surplus of their labor will support all. In fact, the economy will collapse without it at that point. And it's nearer than you think. 

&gt;you are saying, people only do those ""shitty"" jobs, because they are 'forced' to, where the alternative is starvation.

No, we have welfare. You won't starve, you'll just be absolutely poor. Let's be honest here. UBI isn't about starving, it's about having enough money to engage in the economy divorced from the need to work. Which is awesome! **If** there's someone to do the work for cheap still, yet produce enough surplus to pay for the UBI

I have done a serious amount of number crunching on this over the years. It's not possible yet. And unfortunately, when we are ready, people will still resist it. But I'll be right by your side then, calling for it's implementation. A Robotopia is the only real chance we have to get it. And it's actually on it's way.

Actually, UBI would award to all, the choice of working or not working, for reasons other than obtaining a subsistence level income. The whole point is to drop this spacious notion that society would go to shit if nobody had to work for bare survival.

Only choice to become productive, for the reward of access to even more resources, and maybe some of the stuff higher up on maslow's hierarchy of needs, is proposed with a UBI. Not forcing other people to do work.

Are you forced to work, by the handful people who opt to drop out of creating value? I surely am not. I'd take their money as my product has a marginal cost of zero anyway, and appreciate the additional access to resources, that money awards. Even if it didn't have a marginal cost of zero, the production of most products can be scaled while impacting the per unit price very little, or even can push it downwards, if Research and Development are huge factors in production.

To begin with, it's highly questionable that people do not have a monetary claim to a humble amount of resources derived from nature, regardless of how productive they are, if we consider each other as equals. Nature isn't there for just the 'productive' people.

&gt; if you don't, others are forced - by necessity - to work

you mean 'by higher wages', not 'by necessity'. It's called the free market. I certainly will not commit to certain kinds of jobs today, as long as I am amble to avoid em, or as long as benefits are tied to picking up those jobs. Since that just ruins the price finding mechanism for those jobs, turning those jobs into some sort of communism for the poor, or slave labor scheme. Not a process suited for someone with an expressed liking of the free market.

On the other hand, if everyone had a basic income, I would be far more willed to take a menial work job, even if the wage stays around the same, and get a little more flexibility on the working hours, get to actually negotiate some of the job, basically.

As a fan of the free market, it just doesn't strike me as a bad idea, if the wage finding and work condition negotiation process is not inhibited in such an abject fashion as is done today.

Even if you feel like those opting out somehow enslave those who voluntarily participate. Yeah sure, you lure people in to work, via higher wages (or just wages at all, I mean it is extra money; the more people opt out the more there's high wages to be had, though. Till the wages get too high to compete with automation. Then again empiric evidence hints at people not massively, voluntarily, quitting the workforce, just because they could.) or more say in working hour allocation, how sick would that be.

Funnily enough, UBI would be a step away from those seeking education as a means to get a 'basic income', exploiting those stuck in minimum wages. Since providing people an education that cannot be monetized, costs more than just giving people money to live, and letting those people figure out where their time can *actually* be spent productively. It's double trouble to tie people to higher education regardless of what they study, as you don't just commit resources of other people to the process, you also commit the student's bright waking hours to a scam. That the student might not even be aware of. We need to be upfront with people that they gotta look around for themsevles where they see opportunity to make a difference in the world, if they want some sort of recognition as being productive, and to make a nice little profit in the process. But this is an endeavour that you cannot force people to do easily, there's just too many layers of work involved that aren't easily quantifiable.

* To avoid a VAT hitting poor people too hard, Yang said he would exempt certain staples that would hit poorer Americans the hardest.
* To avoid any slight price increases from the VAT for people on benefits (who didn't opt for the dividend), Yang said he would increase the amounts received by benefit recipients to match any inflation caused by the VAT
* For the rest of us, we're getting $1000/mo. We'd need to spend way more than $1000 to pay the $1000 in any price increase caused by the VAT. A net gain for all Americans.","Taxes, Non-UBI government welfare programs, Living costs.",esx69ej,,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This is why I lean a bit right when it comes to borders, because while I think immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers need to be treated well, I see the long term solution as improving the situation in their home countries (for instance, by paying them a fair value for their labor and goods, offering *actual* aid to those countries, addressing climate change and mitigation, and maybe not doing economic and political coups on the regular). 

This is also because we simply cannot afford to take everyone in, as much as I wish we could. This is especially the case if we want to expand the social safety net and implement things like a UBI. 

This isn't to say that I think we should close the borders, but I think we have to be realistic about how many people we can afford to take in. Sadly, there are limits. 

lastly, as much as I want to help those who want to immigrate, we *also* need to help those who are here. Increased immigration (esp illegal immigration) reduces the cost of labor. It's just supply and demand. 
It's not clear that welcoming more immigrants, and thus helping them, is a moral win if it means reduced jobs and income for people already here.

Obamacare is probably not making healthcare cheaper, it may be slowing the rate of growth in healthcare costs.

Finally, given the way things are going, with income for the majority stagnating, I would be skeptical about high returns in the coming future.  We are now competing with China and India there's going to be downward wage pressure. There's been a lot of QE to keep the bubble inflated.

If it was me starting a settlement it would be founded on a charter and operate much like a corporation, with residents as shareholders. One of the charter requirements would be that the settlement provide for all basic needs, including life support and communication. Additional goals would be expansion and profitable exports, among other things. Organization would be by department, with department heads elected (by shareholders) from a pool of competent candidates. That competency test ensures that a politician could only get the position if they were also a competent manager and understood the responsibilities of the department. Direction would be from a board formed of department heads and elected representatives. Representation would be fair as each shareholder's vote carries equal weight even if it carries unequal revenue shares. Anyone born into the colony would automatically be a shareholder. Anyone wishing to immigrate could either buy their way in or be invited for some particular skill.  

It wouldn't be cashless; anyone wanting more than basic rations and housing would need to work for credit that can be used for limited resources and imports. School and vocational training would be paid as if it were a job. There would be a bonus for anyone with a specific set of skills necessary to keep the settlement running (first aid, hydroponic production and electrical maintenance for example) so there's a reason to get training and take certs even if you're not aiming for an exciting career as an airlock maintenance technician or hydroponic sludge removal engineer. In an emergency, nearly the entire population of the settlement should be able to lend a hand with triage or damage control and then assist with cleanup and repairs afterwards to get everything on track as quickly as possible.  

Departments would post jobs to obtain labor and achieve their goals, so there would be a job pool available from the beginning. It will be focused on the tasks needed to fill basic needs for the population, to expand the settlement and to invest in efforts that might make the settlement profitable. I suspect a bidding mechanism would lead to 'undesirable' jobs like sanitation being among the highest paying. Anyone who wanted could try starting their own business, although they would need to have cash to pay for the resources they use in the process. Taxes would be on unearned income and private imports; I imagine this would often be paid with a percentage of production output.

- Legislation on part-time employment with regards to abusing the system to avoid benefits (e.g. large companies like walmart are required to have only 1 part-time employee per every X full-time employees).

- Legislation for maternity and paternity leave so parents can actually get to bond with their child and be there for the most formative and important months of early development.

- Legislation for paid sick leave and paid family leave (so little billy or sally can go to the doctor when sick without Mom and Dad worrying that it means they can't afford food or rent or get fired).

- Universal healthcare so that children can get the healthcare their parents can't afford (and to make the prior bullet point on part-time work unnecessary)

- Universal day-care so that children can be given the attention they need in their formative early years to succeed and parents can still work.

- Heavy taxes on the wealthiest people, including wealth and inheritance taxes, to fund the afore mentioned social programs to help the poor.

- Universal Basic Income (a more distant future endeavor to fight the scarcity of jobs in a post-automation world).

- A judicial system that focuses on rehabilitation rather than retribution.  This includes medical treatment for drug abuse instead of jail time, and therapy for mental issues.

These are all things that absolutely would help the poor but require a gigantic societal change.

690,"I would also add that $10k/year is only slightly more welfare benefits in Quebec. If I were to build a basic income tax, that's also where I would ballpark the lower bound for that reason. ",Budget and finance.,ckrrcla,"&gt; This article is talking about giving money to people. Government bonds and Treasury bills are the opposite, a loan that people make to the government.

But the government rates act as a bound for private rates.  The sovereign is seen as the closest thing possible to a risk-free creditor, since at worst they can print money to repay debts.

The Bank of Canada maintains an interest rate spread about its target (1%) rate: it will pay banks 0.75% interest on their reserve balances, but charge 1.25% on overnight loans.  Bank-to-bank loans operate around the 1% midpoint of that band, by design.

That's different than the US situation, where short-term rates are near zero across the board.  The US Fed's QE programs have gone so far as to push yields on riskier assets down, though purchases of mortgage-backed securities and such.

&gt; First, this article is proposing to give people $18,000 a year - that's a lot more than $5,000. 

Yeah, $18k/yr is a lot.  Were I dictator of Canada, I'd look at something closer to half that.  $10k/yr/person is approximately 2/3 of the low-income cutoff, and at the low-income cutoff (of $15k for a single person) a household is supposed to be spending approximately 2/3 of their income on food, shelter, and clothing.

&gt; Second, eliminating tax incentives for retirement savings and charitable donations would be a disaster. 

Possibly.  The counter-argument goes that retirement tax credits have poor distributional effects, in that those who can best take advantage of them are already the wealthier.

In terms of reducing abject poverty amongst seniors, the OAS/GSP pairing is by far the most powerful government instrument.  They also work (independently and together) as a guaranteed minimum income: OAS provides a flat (taxable) amount, whereas GIS is a ""top up"" to the level of a CPP pension.

Retirement savings are an important way of preserving *relative* income in retirement, and that motivation is made explicit in Ontario's supplemental pension plan.  That is a worthwhile governmental goal, but it's not clear whether it should be of higher or lower priority than basic anti-poverty measures.

&gt; In the short term, it would cost charities a lot more than it costs the government.

That's an interesting question, isn't it?  Would eliminating the charitable tax credit actually reduce donations by more than the amount of the credit?  I don't have numbers, but I'm skeptical that the marginal effect would be that large.

Truth be told, a basic income also allows society to implement other ""good idea"" tax and wage rules without as much concern for equity.  For example, if a basic income of $10k/yr were guaranteed, then it would be reasonable to have a 30% *flat* income tax^(1): the effective tax structure would still be very progressive, but without building in any incentives for income-sheltering.

Likewise, with a substantial basic income, there's less moral weight behind economy-distorting minimum wages.  Wage income does not serve as a primary anti-poverty measure in this environment, so there's no moral reason that an employer and employee couldn't agree on a $2/hr wage for a task.  At the same time, the employee wouldn't be at risk of abject poverty for *not* accepting the offer, so she would be in a better bargaining position at the outset.

Of particular interest to Atlantic Canada, a basic income in lieu of permanent-EI would make off-season work more productive.  As it stands, for many EI is both a necessary income support to fight poverty and a powerful disincentive to take (lower-paid) off-season jobs.  (At the same time, EI nationally is borderline unfit-for-purpose, so the program should be overhauled regardless of basic income.)

^(1 -- Would this compensate for the cost of the minimum income? I don't know, I don't have the tax-policy-simulation data.  At the same time, we should probably also look at flat rates for capital; perhaps 15% tax on dividends combined with a 15% CIT for the same net 30%.

717,"&gt; If the population stays the same, you might have a point, but the US population has TRIPLED since suffrage.

One, my example numbers are from 1970, not sufferage.    
Two, my numbers ARE taking into account the population growth. There is 17% more of the total female population today that's 16 and older that's working or seeking work than there was in 1970. Like I said, if 43% of the potential female work force worked like in 1970 instead of the 60% today, there would be roughly 30 million less workers (as in 30 million less today than it is now, not 30 million less than in 1970). Considering the sizable unemployment that still plagues the country and the lowered wages from the pressure of a hefty labor pool, this is putting dramatic downward pressure on wages for both working men and the remaining working women.    
    
&gt;  Women joining the workforce along with men opened up more jobs in support fields, everything from daycare to house cleaning to health care fields.    
    
This may be true, but I can't see how that either justifies the massive jump in unemployment or cheap labor. We can talk about a lot of things that this is actually a problem for (value of in home raising of children vs. none, general home care, social benefits of having a stay-at-home spouse, etc), but honestly these don't carry a clear, direct economic effect (even though they do carry a massive, dramatic effect in the long run, but that's for another topic). In either case, all you're really saying is that by having more women in the workforce, we've created more jobs to fill the positions that stay at home moms left.    
    
&gt;  This offsets a great deal of what you seem to be talking about. Note also that women often don't compete for all of the same jobs as men    
    
This is true. Construction, emergency services (firemen, policemen, etc, and yes, I know I put ""men"" instead of ""person""), and a whole mess of other fields that are more technical or science based are male dominated and don't look to be shifting anytime soon. However the first two are obviously dangerous and call for physical ability that are not as common in women and the last isn't a range that many women care about, for whatever reason you'd like to conclude. You still don't see men taking up secretary, waitress, or elementary teaching jobs in the droves, though. This still ignores the majority of jobs that are pretty close to evenly split, or even increasingly favoring women. Once again, these are not really men leaving the fields, but more about women encroaching into these markets in numbers. And once again, this drives down wages.    
    
&gt;  Articles and studies like these make a very clear point that women in the workforce have a net INCREASE in GDP for these nations.    
    
No duh. If you throw in child labor, you'll get even more GDP. Might as well pull people out of retirement and squeeze them for all they can produce too! We're not talking about GDP. That has nothing to do with this topic, but it's a no brainer that the more workers you have, the more GDP you have.    
    
Getting more on point, it's not so surprising to see that [real wages](http://www.theresilientfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Real-Wages-Long-Term.jpg) have stagnated pretty consistently with how much women have entered the workforce. Also not at all surprisingly, this lowers the ability of one person to support a family, leading to both parents (or adults if no children) working, increasing the labor pool, and further pushing the problem out until two working adults cannot afford common comforts (and I think we can all agree that this is the case for many today). The only reasonable way (without basic income being a factor, but even with) to turn back this effect is a smaller labor pool to offset that massive increase by so many women entering it.
Your article does nothing to help address the issue either. In fact it touches on point that along with the benefits of more working women, there's a clear and obvious collection of problems associated with it. I also like how it more or less equates to an opinion piece, but again, that's not the point.",Labor wages and work conditions.,ceacba2,"&gt;It also can't be denied that a larger labor pool means lowered wages.

If the population stays the same, you might have a point, but the US population has TRIPLED since suffrage.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_the_United_States

Similarly, the US remains one of the only nations on Earth going forward that has a net INCREASE in population due to birth rates and immigration.  

All of this means that there are more people to perform work, but also that more work needs to be performed.

Women joining the workforce along with men opened up more jobs in support fields, everything from daycare to house cleaning to health care fields.

This offsets a great deal of what you seem to be talking about.  Note also that  women often don't compete for all of the same jobs as men and that there are still a huge percentage of men AND women who now take on the role of homemaker (instead of just being primarily women) and what you've seen is a SHIFT in employment gender, not a collapse of wages due to a flood of employees.

Articles and studies like these make a very clear point that women in the workforce have a net INCREASE in GDP for these nations.

Anyhow, as far as his policies designed to help those in need or exploited, Yang supports Medicare for All, low income housing development, lifting the cap on social security, slashing student loan debt, and making college much more affordable. 

The part you missed about welfare is that many people in need don’t even get $1000 a month now. This gives them that security no matter where in the country they go, instantly. They don’t need to wait several months from now to be deemed eligible. They won’t lose it in another state. It’s theirs. Obviously there is more that should be done, but as Yang states, it’s a good start. Though he sees welfare as a different issue to UBI.

Yang said himself that he doesn’t see the dividend as welfare. He sees it as our wealth that we are all entitled to as shareholders in our country. Look at so many of the big tech companies that have prospered off of our data, our attention, and our business, then fail to pay their fair share in taxes. Essentially, many Americans don’t see the wealth they help generate. Again, this isn’t his welfare plan, though you keep saying it is. However, it is obvious how it can help so many in our current welfare system. 

Th VAT is the best mechanism for taxing companies. Most transactions come from the supply chain, which currently does not get taxed in our country. It can be tailored to luxury goods and technology, leaving out food and consumer staples. The goal here is to go where the money is, after all. Note that with the dividend, even %10 price increase across the board will only hurt those who spend more than $120K a year. Most people, even considering the worst case scenario, will be helped.

UBI counters the flow of wealth to big corporations and mega urban centers, bring wealth back to families and communities that have been left behind, like the working class in middle America and small town USA.","Taxes, Non-UBI government welfare programs, Business and profit.",eqb6ecy,"&gt;Read through this thread.

You say that like I haven't been writing in response to all the asinine ""but a lot of people will benefit, so ignore who benefits and just bring on the Yangbux, I gots to get mine.""

&gt;no one will be worse off due to the freedom dividend

That's true in the very narrow sense that no one is *directly* harmed.  But that's the same as saying ""no one will be worse off due to tax cuts for the uber-wealthy.""  The fact that the money needs to be repaid means that a whole lot of people will be responsible for a portion of national debt (and eventually cut programs and austerity) they did not benefit from.

&gt;the VAT easily taps into corporate revenue streams currently going untaxed.

Aside from the fact that the cost is passed on to consumers, sure.

723,"I am personally a conservative who thinks Yang is the best of all the democratic candidates. UBI does not stack on top of all other welfare. Cash-like benefits like food stamps would not stack, people on that program would choose between UBI and food stamps",Political affiliations,f7uwvs2,"&gt; Milton, Friedman, a conservative economist, supported UBI

this is a common falsehood pushed by Leftists attempting to justify UBI.  Let's compare:

* [Here is Friedman's interview explaining the Negative Income tax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM)

* Whereas Yang's ""Freedom"" Dividend is defined as: ""a universal basic income of $1,000/month, $12,000 a year, for every American adult over the age of 18. This is independent of one’s work status or any other factor.""

As I understand it, what Friedman suggested was a replacement of the current welfare system with NIT.  Each single adult or family would file with the IRS and if their income was low enough they'd recieve a some money from the fed based on how much their income was.  That amount would be distributed monthly or bimonthly to help avoid people wasting it all at once.  If they held a job this would be added to their paycheck.

Friedman explains that a system like this could better incentivize people to get out of poverty.  The current system, at least in the 60s, gave out benefits that were higher in value than that of a minimum wage job.  This effectively motivated people to be dependent totally on the Fed rather than finding a job.  On the other hand, NIT would continue to pay out, although at a lesser rate, even once you get a job.  As your income grows you would eventually move out of the negative income ""bracket"".

[Further reading on NIT's history](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc1/NegativeIncomeTax.html)

Conversely, Yang's Freedom Dividend is literally a payout from the Fed per month on top of all other welfare, regardless of income.  It's also a rather shameless attempt at buying votes.

For recent data on UBI [here's Finland's attempt from last year](https://www.helsinki.fi/en/news/nordic-welfare-news/heikki-hiilamo-disappointing-results-from-the-finnish-basic-income-experiment).

What do I think?  First and foremost, the welfare system has wreaked havoc on the American family.  This is especially true for African American families where [65%](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/tables/107-children-in-single-parent-families-by#detailed/1/any/false/871/10,9,12,1,185,13/432,431) of children live in single parent households.  What incentive do the mothers have to marry if they're already wed to the State?  Without a father, these children often end up jobless or in jail as adults.  The mothers clearly need more incentive to keep the fathers around.

Could NIT help improve this situation?  Perhaps, but Leftists would likely fuck it up in the end.  IMO, the IRS should be abolished.  It's been used as a political weapon for too long and the income tax was a stupid and economically harmful idea in the first place.  Replace it with a simple 15% Federal sales tax on all goods and services except the typical foods that the Fed usually subsidizes like milk.

Is this just to fund the UBI or is it supposed to fund the rest of government as well? Are you taxing the UBI itself? I'd love to hear the answers, but when I asked elsewhere I got stonewalled. EDIT: Looks like I'm not getting concrete answers again. I swear it's like a mystery cult.

&gt;Yes, this is an increase in taxes, but because of the UBI, it would actually serve to lower the taxes being paid right now, for all but the top 20% in income earners.

&gt;Notice how the 4th quintile of households (the upper middle class) sees their effective tax rates drop from 16.4% to 9%?

I would seriously have to see the numbers behind this. I've learned to distrust the UBI factoids and infographics.

&gt;It would also be possible to reduce income taxes through the implementation of a VAT (consumption tax like Bill Gates wants), or with a LVT (land value tax), or with a financial transaction tax, or we could even do like Alaska does and fund it with royalties claimed on natural resources.

Rather than consider this as a whizzy new policy idea, in the UK we already have a UBI, albeit one that's only available to the old: it's better known as the 'state pension'.

Now there are already lots of concerns about how affordable the current state pension is. The pension pays everyone a bit more than £9k a year. To try to make the pension system sustainable, successive UK governments have had to increase the pension eligibility age from 60 (for women) to 68, and increase the number of qualifying years someone needs to pay into the system to receive the full state pension to 35.

UBI adherents are effectively proposing to reduce the pension age to 18 (or sometimes birth), and to have no requirements for people paying in before they get a payout.

Apparently this can be funded by taxing the rich, or squeezing corporations (who are currently mostly on the verge of going under), or copying Venezuela, or somesuch. Hmm.

Even leave aside the economic concerns about how much UBI would cost, how it could be administered, and how it could be gamed. There are a couple of practical implications that are rarely discussed:

- Assuming every country didn't introduce UBI at the same time and to the same level (and of course they won't), there would be huge immigration pressures on the UK if UBI went ahead here. This would also result in massively increased hostility to recent and new immigrants (or perceived immigrants) - I speak as one myself. This hostility would be horrible and dangerous and fracture society further. Whatever one thinks about immigration, this is not going to help unite society. 

- The introduction of UBI that was universal (ie paid to all, including children) would also put a driving force causing population increases.

Because people are not literally starving for work, employers are incentivized to pay enough to attract workers. But because it's ""gravy"", workers are able to take less or accept fringe benefits. With the shift to casual/""gig"" work we're already halfway there, but without baseline support we end up with precarity rather than prosperity.

There was a surplus of available labor before the pandemic and there remains one today. If you want to complain it's not available for what employers want to pay, then I declare a pony shortage as well. You can say it's because of the pandemic but that's only a matter of degree.

&gt;You mention philosophy like it's a bad thing and it can be, but only if it's irrational. When reading philosophy, you have to decide if it is rational. Passing it off as ""just a theory"" is not a rational dismissal of a philosophy. It is a philosophical fallacy that religious people have used against the likes of evolution. Dismiss philosophy entirely, and you are dismissing rational thought.

Philosophies are models of the world. Disagree with the model and you disagree with its conclusions. There are also various philosophies with no particularly correct one.

The thing is, when I disagree with your idea, it's because my philosophy is way different. I too have set goals and stuff I want to accomplish with UBI, and your idea just has too many issues I feel would conflict with mine. That being said, I feel perfectly a okay pointing out that you're not going to be convincing me because you're approaching the topic from a philosophy i dont subscribe to.

&gt;I invite you to please justify why you think LVT is unfair and ridiculous. 

In short, to sum up my objections in this post:

1) I feel it has a disregard for property rights to a larger extent than I'm comfortable with. While I agree property rights are problematic in their extremes, I am still ultimately a supporter of them. I just think the excesses need to be curbed. The philosophy underlying your implementation of LVT undermines property rights to a greater extent than I deem necessary. I merely want to curb excess, not radically redefine what property rights are.

2) Your solution is too broad. Again, you have a narrow problem that seems to involve you radically redefining property rights to a large amount of the population. I believe problems should be solved in the least restrictive way possible. I find your solution too heavy handed.

3) It contradicts my goals for UBI. I want to provide more financial security for the poor. I want to end the paradigm of forced work and give people a greater level of freedom. An LVT, in my estimation, would pose potentially excessive taxes on people and force them back into wage slavery to pay them off. This is because LVT makes the link between income and taxes less direct. While you made a case for correlation between those two items, that correlation is not absolute, and unless people work to maintain their property, they face the constant threat of homelessness. Which completely undermines the purpose of UBI. That and losing one's high paying job could have horrific consequences.

4) Appeals to economic efficiency as mentioned dont appeal to me. I dont care how people use their land. I dont believe in this form of paternalism you seem to be peddling in which people who dont use their land in the utmost productive way should be forced off of it to make way of someone who can use it ""better"". To me, this is as sociopathic as libertarianism while also being as paternalistic as socialism. Again, I just want to curb the excess.

To focus a little more on the sociopathy of libertatianism, it seems that you seem to believe in the same invisible hand that libertarians do when discussing economic efficiency, but ignore the real...human costs to that. Sure, the land will, thoeretically, be put to the ""best"" use...but is that really desireable? This sounds like a pareto efficiency based ""free market"" argument"", which totally ignores the homelessness, starvation, and exploitation such a theory actually includes. In short, just like free market libertarians, I feel like you grossly overplay the theoretical advantages of an LVT while ignoring the potential real world consequences, which I would see as severe.

5) It could cause an economic crash worse than 2008. This point may invalidate the concept of LVT altogether, but if we force land values down as much as you say, we could cause another housing crash. The taxes could also force a lot of people into homelessness as well in the short term, and your response to this was that the pain would exist initially, but it would be worth it to build a better world. Sounds like something a communist or a nazi would say. No thanks. We need to transition people into a system relatively gently. 

6) It potentially ignores how the housing market actually works. For all its arguments in theory, I have an admittedly conservative friend in the construction industry who I discussed the concept with once. He said if banks were forced to put all their homes on the market, not only would it crash the economy again, but a lot of the homes the banks are currently keeping up would fall into disrepair. They would become worthless, no one would live in them because they decay, and there would be a housing shortage. 

&gt;Could you also elaborate on what you describe as a significantly dialled down LVT implementation would be?

A few possibilities:

1) Instead of a 5% tax, which Im guessing is the single taxer approach to this, what about the current code and a 1% implementation? This might reduce the levels on homeowners low enough to make the tax negligible, even to low income households. other revenue would be addressed in other ways. Seeing how I'm not a single taxer, this would be preferable. We could fund UBI from multiple sources. And as you mentioned, LVT would hit the rich hardest so it would be progressive.

2) Inheritance tax style LVT. Only tax individuals or legally defined ""households"" (or institutions like banks or corporations) if their ""estate"" is worth over a certain amount. This would exclude homeowners as I mentioned and focus on taxing the people gaming the system only, since they would obviously have more than what would be deemed an acceptable amount of land. I'm unsure of this one since I'm still concerned of a housing crash, but still. Worth debating.

3) Corporate land tax. This could be an alternative to the corporate tax, which is easily avoided by inversions and the like. Basically, instead of taxing corporations based on profits, we tax them based on land. Land used for commerical, rather than personal purpose (broadly speaking, landlords and their apartments could be includedin this) would be taxed at a certain percentage. 

I mean, honestly, land value taxes have the potential to be useful revenue raising and social engineering tools. But the ends and the implementation can be debated.

When coming up with a plan, you need to outline your goals, and the link how your plan accomplishes said goals. You also want to address any externalities.

Your LVT ideas are too broad, philosophically guided, and seem to have a lot of overreach beyond the extent I'm willing to give them for my tastes. They have too many externalities and the change is too broad and sweeping. I can possibly get on board with some limited implementation of them, but not a wholesale geolibertarian implementation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, the caveat is, if you believe that that the road to UBI viability is to ensure the top 1% pay their taxes, this is a fantasy. Tax law is written PERMANENTLY (regardless of how you believe it could be changed with changes to the law through democratic vote to re-write tax laws to prevent legal tax evasion through difficult to understand tax loopholes that the ultra wealthy have access too) the way it is and there will always be ways to avoid paying taxes to the degree that you believe they should be.

6,"My whole point is from the perspective of an American, in America, about America, so take that into account as you read.

Andrew Yang argued a similar point in the last dem debate and it got pushed to the side. His exact quote was

[on the topic of prison reform/reparations]
“Elizabeth [Warren], with respect, you can’t regulate away racism with a whole patchwork of laws that are race-specific. What we have to do is heed the writings of Martin Luther King, whose birthday we just celebrated. He said that capitalism forgets that life is social, and what he was championing was a guaranteed minimum income for all Americans of $1000 a month or more that would end up reshaping our economy in communities of color, make it so that black net worth is not 10% of white net worth in this country, which is the most important number of them all. We can’t regulate that away through any other means except by putting money directly into the hands of African Americans and Latinos and people of color to allow businesses to actually flourish and grow in those communities. The only way that will happen is if black and Latino consumers have buying power, and that is where we have to move as a country.”

He’s an open advocate for a UBI that has no gender or racial requirements. I think we’ve see well intentioned propositions (affirmative action) which has seemed to inspire resentment in people. Some laugh these people off as “racists who simply don’t want minorities/women to succeed”, but often it seems they’re simply frustrated with their circumstances and feel no one is helping. Trying to speak to an impoverished white guy who struggles every day about racial inequity can &lt;obviously&gt; backfire horribly.

It seems like racism tends to brood in poverty. You have people who 1) are severely disadvantaged and looking for someone or something to blame and 2) tons of predatory businesses behaviors that really make it hard to break the cycle of poverty and create this aura that the world is out to get you. So when laws are made to pull only a certain category of people out of poverty, it makes sense to see a kick back and even possibly turn people into racists who wouldn’t be otherwise.

People of color in America are at a disadvantage. The poverty rate of white people (11%) dwarves the poverty rate of the African American community (20.8%) and this is directly linked to slavery. This is not really debatable. BUT. You must remember there are still 15 million white Americans in poverty to 8.9 million African Americans. I believe the biggest grave we face in America is the fact that we are more likely to make less money than our parents did than we are to make more.

It seems like there are 2 legitimate solutions to beginning a movement to make strides to really push aside racism in our country. 

1) Prison reform. More specifically, the decriminalization of drugs, and creation of centers for people to use them. The criminalization of drugs was performed by a deeply racist head (Harry Anslinger) of a deeply racist Federal Bureau of Narcotics as an openly racist action against impoverished blacks. The War on Drugs has cost us countless American lives and dollars, and while many blame this on gang violence, there is a simple solution. The only reason drugs are trafficked by gangs is because they are illegal. If we create free injection facilities with free drugs (heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine), these gangs will likely break up and violence around drugs will cease. These drugs are not expensive, and for every dollar this would cost us, we would save many in not having to house harmless prisoners whose lives have been ravaged by substance and stop creating career criminals.

2) Poverty. This one is trickier, but I’m now a believer in Universal Basic Income. $1000 a months for every American over the age of 18. This would effectively raise the minimum wage to $15 without facing the threat of layoffs by large corporations, give value to those who don’t make a wage (stay at home parents), and give job mobility and choice to millions of America living paycheck to paycheck (turns out 70% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck.... I was floored to learn that). This money is a game changer to those in poverty and those living in the margins, and seems to be the most robust way of raising the bottom without creating racial or gender resentment.

I wholeheartedly believe these two policies would do the same thing to society that the legalization of gay marriage did. We are to the point where both parties (for the most part) openly state that there is nothing wrong with being gay and champion themselves on upholding lgbt rights. This was very very different 10 years ago. And it seems like the landmark shifting of public opinion changed with this policy shift.


There are solutions to racial inequity in America. And like OP said I most definitely agree that making laws that are rooted in race will not solve the problems that keep races at odds with each other.

13,"Okay, so my question is, would funding basic income through money creation necessarily force prices to rise? 

My short answer is no. What do you think?

Scott Santens, in the podcast linked to in another post in this forum recently, said basic income would not cause inflation as long it is tax-funded. Scott's theory of inflation rests on the idea that ""more money is chasing the same amount of goods"". I'm trying to point out that simply having more money does not by itself cause prices to rise because there is a psychological component in every price increase.

I'm trying to imagine a pure auction environment, where I bid on every food item at  a store. If I have more money, I can bid higher. If everyone has more money, they can bid higher too. Prices rise but everyone's incomes keep pace, so the real purchasing power of bidders does not decrease as prices rise. This is something like the stock market, where asset price rises are defined as wealth creation.

My basic theory is that, in neoclassical economic terms, government can force a new, more income-equal equilibrium by raising everyone's incomes as prices rise, through money creation.

If there are shortages, we must ask why those shortages appear when money is created for a  basic income. I think the answer is, psychology. If the shortages don't appear now when poors don't have money, that means that there really is a shortage now and the poors are suffering from it daily. Then the idea that money creation causes inflation is really support for the status quo where shortages are already in effect, just not noticeable if you aren't poor.

But is it really the case that we can't produce enough to meet everyone's basic needs? I have seen figures from http://www.fao.org/home/en/ that show we produce enough grain alone to provide everyone with ~2500 calories a day. Would money creation to fund a basic income change that? ",Money and inflation,dpcrnbp,"I agree with you, for basic needs that shouldn't change prices. Maybe a UBI would stabilize the cost of such items. For other things groupthink can change demand, seasonal changes can change demand. Neither necessarily *force* price changes IMO. There's different items like non-perishable or perishables. It's hard to compare bullets with food IMO, the consumption rates are hugely different. Shelf life, a mega-ton of factors really.

However a business might choose to raise prices for a few months on select items to help subsidize the slow months on a different set of items. Most shops diversify (in a big, often complex way), they're playing a constant balancing act. 


A tipping point would be where they can't deliver enough items fast enough to keep shelves full and fresh.. especially perishables. If this is because of the supplier, across many stores, it's probably a seasonal shortage. Importing then becomes the reason prices rise, logistical costs. 


Business is usually a competitive environment, if you don't keep stock conveniently available, your competitor will, that will drive you out of business. It's different with non-perishable items. 


So not only are you balancing the product range, you're jostling and competing with competitors, this can lead to some choices as you say. 


Some markets are very competitive, others are hardly at all.. Unfortunately in more competitive ones some can choose to do some not so nice tricks.. they can save up, and then undercut, etc. Or like Amazon they get annual customers from a wide net of places to to subsidize costs... and so they offer lower priced items... and there goes the competition.

Again, and I totally agree about shortages of entirely necessary items. Maybe a UBI would stabilize the cost of such items and reduce competitive tendencies for business offering such things.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry, ranty run-on!
Will there be people who just want to ""collect money for breathing?"" Almost definitely. Does it change the fact that real people need help, and we could help them in better ways than we are today, if we made it a real priority? Not really. 

If 10% of people that get help don't need it and just want to not work (assuming there are just jobs everywhere in this hypothetical land), and 90% of them do, then I have no issues pitching in. I wouldn't mind some good rules and oversight to reduce the changes of fraud (got to make them work for it, if you'll pardon the joke), of course, but I could deal with 1 in 10 people. Hell, let's go as high as 2 or 3 in 10, and I'd still feel that way (though I would definitely press hard for some better fraud prevention if it were that high).

&gt; no taxes at all for those on UBI

Well, not sure why/how the government would bother to tax the money it's giving to them (rather than just reducing what they give out and saving a step or two), but those people would certainly pay sales tax, and since they'd be spending actual cash (under UBI, for example), they have more options on the places they can spend it, which helps that money get back into the system and keep the economy churning. 

I'm not sure why you keep having to put negativity into the mouths of those supporting tax increases for the upper income brackets - saying that it's about hate for the rich, those ""rich bastards,"" etc. - I don't hear most people who support things like UBI or free/very low cost higher education say things like that. I do hear lots of ""examples"" and imitations of supporters saying things like that, though.
Lower tax rates in the upper income brackets strongly correlate (over the last 60 years or so) with reduced overall economic well being and a weaker middle class (and, not surprisingly, an increase in the income gap between the upper income brackets and everyone else, as well as wage stagnation for the non-upper income people taxpayers). Yes, correlation, not causation, but this idea that lower income taxes on the highest brackets is somehow good for everyone has yet to demonstrate even that much.","Taxes, Public services and healthcare.",cviz2k0,"

16,"Market socialism can exist, and it is theorized to require a strong state forever due to the nature of a market turning socialism into capitalism. Having a state makes it pretty unappealing to socialists who want full communism i.e. an abolition of the state. 

Markets with capital means that you still have capital as an autonomous force (and this is from Marx), so people will say that market socialism *is* capitalism or else will turn into capitalism over time.

It's still far, far better than what we have now and could be a transitory period on the way to giving people real control over the fate of their communities. I might rank systems which give power to people to control the fate of themselves and their communities as follows:

* slavery &lt; free market capitalism with all its inherent oppressions &lt; neoliberalism &lt; liberalism &lt; social democratism &lt; the former with basic income and universal care &lt; market socialism &lt; (ill-defined) marketless socialism with democratic distribution (now we can eliminate the state) &lt; communism.

I'm discluding degenerate ideologies such as fascist capitalism and Communism with a capital C, though there are things to learn from the latter if we are to avoid the same

-----------------

I have to disagree with them that market socialism is not socialism however. They can (rightly) invoke Marx as I did above to show that capital still acts as its own force (outside of the control of workers, and pitting workers against each other), but that would only show that it is socialism with issues to solve (probably with a state). To anyone who would argue that socialism requires abolition of the state, I won't get into an argument of definitions. The definitions I am working under are clear from my arguments and are in wide use regardless. Market socialism gives workers control of the means of production and is thus fully socialism. Other fully socialist systems can have as many or more problems, and are less attainable right now.

Market socialism has its own merits and shouldn't be disregarded as fringe as it is by purists in the other subs. At least market socialism has a direct mantra to stand behind, a clear system to handle distribution, and relatively clear goals, which cannot be said for nearly any socialist ideology in the linked subreddit. It also has a clear path toward implementation which is through worker cooperatives (yes yes /r/muhcoops, but cooperatives do give workers more power which is what we all claim to want).",Economic systems.,d97q13r,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They want to improve their intrinsic worth(financially of course) to get better jobs. I'm very skeptical of labor unions. 
In a nutshell it's about free markets. 
• One of the arguments or the main argument I should say that economists from the austrian and chicago school is the minimum wage argument, which explains why most of them don't like labor unions. 
• Inflation. Money printing devalues the dollar. (It's not rocket science)

Under most UBI proposals, there is no more money in the system.

As the article states, there is very little evidence that this would be cheaper or more efficient.

&gt;
&gt; To deliver all this, a UBI would need to be provided to every Australian adult, at least at the rate of the age pension, currently $814 a fortnight. That equates to over $400 billion a year.

&gt; Our current welfare budget is around $160 billion a year. Not all of this could be saved – a significant chunk is spent on administration.

So, just getting the top .001% of earners to pay 40% tax rather than the 17% they are paying today will result in an additional 14.26 billion in tax revenues.

2) there must then be the option to work more to earn more

71,"&gt; You obviously have no skills that anyone really wants and no ability to learn anything else

Actually, I have skills that people definitely want, but wages have been driven down by demand for jobs and I'm lucky to get paid at all in the only place in town that's hiring.

&gt; Also, you've accepted .25 a day.

It was that or nothing.  I'm very, very poor and vulnerable, you see.

&gt; This is the result of your extreme example that isn't based on anything other than trying to make a point.

Somehow this is bad?  Yes, I'm trying to make a point.  Obviously.  So are you.  My point is that when people aren't paid enough, a tax credit isn't going to magically make them solvent.  Minimum wage laws are what keep our labor market from devolving into slavery.  If you're allowed to pay next to nothing and you only care about money -- and you may think that such people are morally evil, but they certainly exist -- then that's exactly what you're going to do, pay the least amount that you can get away with, and people desperate for jobs will take literally anything they can get because they're too desperate to turn down an offer.

My company, in real life, doesn't pay me the least possible amount it can get away with.  That's because it realizes that employee retention is important, at least in my role, since it would cost too much to hire and then train someone else to do my job, so it pays me an amount where I feel valued as an employee and don't feel pressure to leave and go somewhere else that pays better.  But my job happens to be something that requires skill and education and is in relatively high demand these days.  Not all people have the privilege I have of possessing this skill and education in an in-demand field, but they still need to eat and they still need shelter.  We live in a society that believes (rightly or wrongly) that you shouldn't get money for free except as a last resort, so we don't just pay people a UBI.  So we have to reward work somehow.  If I do not have skills or education, well, there's still stuff I can do, but there are only so many jobs available, and that means that employers can get away with paying less and less.  And how do you retain employees in a race to the bottom?  You pay them the same as everyone else is paying.  If everyone pays $0.25 a day, then you can say no to this job, but the other one will give you the same deal so you're stuck.  And when your money runs out, you can't just hold out for something better to come along.  You take what you can take.  I may not have education or skills, or my education and skills may be relevant to some occupation that is no longer relevant today for whatever reason (industry moved out, resource depleted, technology made it obsolete, whatever), but I still need money to survive somehow!

Obviously the $0.25 a day is an extreme example.  But I could have used today's minimum wage and it would still be an extreme example; it would just require more research than I'm willing to spend on a Reddit comment to list prices for everything to show how impossible the budget is.

72,"In his 1930 essay “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren”, John Maynard Keynes sought to counter the pessimism of the time by predicting that rising living standards and technological advancements would enable a 15-hour week by the beginning of the 21st century. “For the first time since his creation,” he wrote, “man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem – how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.”

But though, as Keynes anticipated, living standards rose, the working week did not fall. Nearly 90 years after his essay, Britons work an average of 42.3 hours a week, the highest level of full-time hours in the EU (the lowest – 37.8 hours – is in Denmark). Productivity (output per hour), however, is 13 per cent below the G7 average. Overwork, leading to illness, absenteeism and low investment (among the worst in the G7), is emblematic of the new “British disease”.

A shorter working week has historically been a defining cause of the labour movement. Between 1900 and the Great Depression, the average Western working week was reduced from 60 hours to below 35. But in the post-war corporatist era, after the experience of mass unemployment, governments and businesses united to revere labour.

Until recently, the notion of a four-day week was largely confined to radical texts such as Alex Williams and Nick Srnicek’s Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work and Rutger Bregman’s Utopia for Realists. But as the UK confronts the costs of overwork, the idea – part of what I have called Corbynism 2.0 – is moving from the fringes to the mainstream.

In 2017, the Green Party included a four-day week in its election manifesto, and last year the TUC backed the idea of a progressively shorter working week. A new 95-page report published today by the pioneering think tank Autonomy – The Shorter Working Week: A Radical and Pragmatic Proposal – represents the most detailed and persuasive case yet for a four-day week.

“This is a vital contribution to the growing debate around free time and reducing the working week,” shadow chancellor John McDonnell said of the report, signalling the Labour leadership’s endorsement. “With millions saying they would like to work shorter hours, and millions of others without a job or wanting more hours, it’s essential that we consider how we address the problems in the labour market as well as preparing for the future challenges of automation.” The left is resurrecting one of the classic socialist critiques of capitalism: that it makes humans unfree.

“The time we spend in work is neither natural nor inevitable,” the report notes. “Instead, the amount of time we spend in work is a political question.” Crucially, Autonomy emphasises that a four-day week is not just radical but credible. Research has long shown that, far from lowering productivity, shorter working hours increase it by reducing physical and mental illness, absenteeism, worker turnover and early retirement. There is no positive correlation between long worker hours and productivity: Germany is more productive than the UK (by 26.7 per cent) but works fewer hours on average; Mexico and Greece are less productive, but work more.  And for those part-time workers who wish to work more, a four-day week would aid the redistribution of time. 

Increased investment in technology, as well as a higher minimum wage to raise the cost of labour, would accelerate automation and make a four-day week conceivable. A recent trial by the New Zealand trust manager Perpetual Guardian proved so successful – higher productivity, reduced stress – that the firm is considering making it permanent.

Employers would be incentivised to improve the UK’s lamentable record of investment in machinery, robots and ICT: in 2017, Britain had just 33 robot units for every 10,000 employees, compared with 93 in the US, 170 in Germany and 154 in Sweden.


Greater productivity, the report notes, would eliminate the need to reduce wages in line with working hours. It argues for an extension of sectoral collective bargaining (the UK currently has the second-lowest level of coverage in Europe) to enable trade unions, businesses and governments to achieve “the correct balance between time and income”.

Further benefits of a four-day week include a reduced burden on healthcare services (poor mental health at work is estimated to cost employers £33-42bn, or 2 per cent of GDP, a year); greater environmental sustainability through a reduction in the number of commutes and an increase in low-carbon activities (such as walking or cycling instead of driving, and cooking with fresh ingredients rather than heating energy-intensive frozen food products); and increased gender equality by encouraging men to bear more of the burden of unpaid work and care.


To this end, Autonomy argues for the introduction in law of a new “UK Working Time Directive” (based on the European Working Time Directive) that would decrease annually with a medium-term target of achieving a full-time working week of 32 hours (or four days) by 2025.

The public sector would be used to pioneer lower hours without lower pay, new workers’ rights would give employees the option to take any rise in remuneration in the form of a reduced working week, the number of bank holidays would be increased from eight to 14 (in line with countries such as Spain and Malta) and policies such as universal basic income, universal basic services and sovereign wealth funds would be trialled to sustainably support life outside of work.

The history of progress is of once radical ideas – the right to strike, a free universal health service, a minimum wage – becoming orthodox. A four-day week could soon join them. ",Labor wages and work conditions.,eficdvo,,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Maybe I'm bending the rules, but I don't think tiny raises like that exclude one from the ""minimum wage"" bracket, if switching jobs *keeps* you at minimum wage by returning the ""I worked here a while, can I have a raise"" situation back to square one. That is, I do not count ""tenure"" based raises as something which removes one from the minimum wage situation - if you don't have the experience to get a job above minimum wage when switching jobs, you're a minimum wage employee.

The article also makes a point that wages only grow reliably for jobs with on-the-job training; that's before we start talking about how businesses do *not* raise other wages when minimum increases.

Given that minimum wage in the US (at least) is based currently on a basic income expectation, that is, higher than the poverty line, I don't see how it becomes racist or classist. It's often raised specifically due to cost of living requirements, and is raised in specific states and even cities due to outrageous costs.

Here's where I see minimum wage's ""protective"" aspect, and where I don't see it being ""racist"" unless the individual is racist themselves (at which point they don't need ""minimum wage"") Employers would, in fact, rather pay $4 an hour than $8. However, you *cannot* live off $4 an hour in this country, and the only people who *do* work that cheap don't *actually* live here, they're seasonal or migrant workers, or even illegal immigrants who get paid less so they *don't* end up in the system.

I fail to see how this is racist; specific companies utilized it in racist form in South Africa, but I fail to see how utilizing something makes it inherently racist - as well, I don't understand how your % quote about black teens stems from, and is enforced by, minimum wage laws.

As far as I can see, minimum wage protects employees from nationalist discrimination - for the same reason employers take their businesses overseas, they also hire scab and illegal workers for less pay. It's *hard* to get a job in Austin, TX as a white dude, unless you have *good* skills, or are willing to work for less under-the-table. If anything, enforcement of minimum wage results in a fair deal - if not for out-of-country workers, who put themselves in a shitty living situation in order to ""afford"" to work that cheap, I could see your point about it being a useless law, but as it is, all I see is the pointing out of it being manipulated in a specific situation where racism was *already* massively widespread.

As it is, you don't have to use minimum wage to have racist hiring practices, so I fail to see how it enforces it. The study you linked even makes a point of showing that it's only a 20% chance to go above minimum wage *IF* you have extra training. 

I guess my CMV question to challenge you would be: If it's somehow enforcing systemic racism, then how will that racism be ""solved/removed from the situation"" by removing the law?

I wonder what everyone's thoughts are on these from a leftist perspective.

You pretty much covered UBI. I know David Graeber vehemently supports UBI and opposes JG (since bullshit jobs and all), for the main reason that UBI is unconditional and introduces a concept that having a job should not be a requirement to thrive in a society. Also, importantly, it removes means testing. 

My concern with UBI is I think in reality it will be implemented in hellworld style, where all other welfare programs will be cancelled, since hey, you got UBI now. Second issue is that I don't see why millionaires should be receiving any additional funds, but I think no-means-testing kinda outweighs this. Third, I don't see how UBI that actually provides enough to live off for everybody wouldn't be massively inflationary.

On the other hand, you see a bunch of MMT people like Stephanie Kelton advocating JG, which means a bunch of DSA and Our Revolution politicians take cues from them. From Graeber's perspective, for example, that would just create a bunch of bullshit jobs. I kinda see his point. From MMT perspective, JG is not universal, so millionaire don't also get paid. It's not inflationary, because it's not as massive as UBI, and it actually creates real resources and real assets in the economy (e.g. infrastructure JG program). 

Then you have NIT, which is a favorite among r/neoliberal crowd.

131,"Yang doesn't have to eliminate any welfare programs, and has said he doesn't intend to. The reason is that the FD is opt in and doing so will take you off most cash-like welfare programs but not for example housing assistance and SSDI. So for anyone on wefare for which the FD would be an upgrade, which is most people on welfare (average is $404) they would just choose to forego their welfare. For those people which the FD would be a downgrade they would stay on their programs. So Yang doesn't eliminate any programs but still saves the money because people jump off them by themselves. 

The point of welfare (at least where I live) is to provide the needing with what they need, not more or less. So if the $1000 each month went straight into everyone's bank account then it would be up to each individual program/case worker to decide the new eligibilities. This would have roughly the same result as Yangs approach as a whole (if the welfare programs work as intended) but it would be highly variable for individuals who are at the mercy of their case workers. And some would end up with less then they had! Yang's approach doesn't hurt anyone.

Americans need to stop labeling things all the time. It's a heuristic that leads to oversimplifications and bias. Take me for example I'm very opinionated but my opinions doesn't necessarily reflect a political side in USA. It doesn't even completely reflect a political party here in Norway and we have over 20 to chose from, although only 9 relevant ones. It's much better to think about the merits of each individual policy, how it solves a problem, what other effects it would have and so on. Saying that's to the left or that's to the right is a heuristic that is bad to use in regards to something as complex as politics. There is no one ideology such that if you just believe in it it fixes all problems and is perfect. If you have an ideology then you are overgeneralizing. Each of the myriad of problems and issues require a tailored solution, but every once in a while there comes a solution that fixes a lot of issues and UBI is an extreme example of it. Look if you don't trust anything I say so be it, but please believe that I don't know a single person who subscribes to an ""ideology"" like you do in USA and we have political conversation that can't really be compared to anything in USA except early interviews of Andrew Yang before he started to repeat himself like everyone else.","- Non-UBI government welfare programs

The way unemployment benefits work now is: someone receives $15/hr from UB, a small business owner offers wages of $16/hr, whoever takes the job will lose the $15/hr income, effectively making it so the American salt-of-the-earth worker would only be making $1/hr. Because you're a strong independent conservative who don't need no state I assume you have a thorough understanding of economics, especially something as fundamental as the law of supply and demand. An additional $1/hr won't generate very much demand for other economic actors to sell their time. Unfortunately, the data show most small businesses fail in the first 5 years, so we know for a fact most business owners are incompetent. This whole problem started in the first place because they can't afford to increase their wages to a point that they attract employees.

&gt;I have been reading about people in USA in a similar situation here for a while now and I really struggle to understand why so many people still revere the US lifestyle as something great. I live in Finland and I've met people from all around the world and most of them look up to USA and have this dream that it would be amazing living there with the wages you have.
The problem I keep seeing is exactly what you write here. Yes, the money might be good, it might be great, but you still have to pay for a lot of the basic things that are taken for granted in other countries because of better taxation. For example for me the education, housing during the studies, food and medication is all supported by the government. It's all taken for granted. The added benefits are that it's very safe here and I don't need to plan my possible children's futures years ahead because they cost so much to get through their studies. I also don't have to worry for sick leave or to lose my position because of it and such things which some people here have said that they keep stressing them needlessly.
And I'm not talking here about the upper middle class or the upper class. Even the poorest countries have their wealthy few at the top; that is no way to measure a country's well being. I'm talking about the core, the middle class and how badly the lower class is struggling and how much this complicates everyone's life. And in this I see much struggle in USA.
I see universal basic income as the next step in all this. It just makes perfect sense. It solves many of the issues with inequality that this monetary system puts on us. I don't mean that we'd be in a socialist heaven, but it would be a step towards a place where we would all just struggle less with basic day-to-day life and I'm all for it. The people at the top would suffer as they'd lose control which is why I think we're not seeing that big of a progress on this matter.

In many parts of the country that's considered a working class living wage. That's the equivalent of a job that pays $11/hr.   What's the incentive for a person to actually get a job?  The reason Yang picked $12/year is because it puts you slightly below the poverty line, so you're still incentivized to generate your own value.  Don't we want to live in a society where people are incentivized to try their luck at work or starting a business?

So that covers the working age population.  For those who can't work, UBI still stacks on top of your disability and social security check.   We don't want to keep people below the poverty line just because they can't work.

Also, I would remind people that Yang isn't a one issue candidate.  Med4All is a key component of his platform that would take a lot of pressure off poor people.   Yang is also proposing other marginal revenue streams like data dividend, social currency and democracy dollars.

That progressive socialist stuff that you love so much only works when you have traditional family structures and a relatively cohesive and homogenous population with a strong shared identity.

1. You're wrong here, both about Warrens positions and the issues. Breaking up Amazon and Google isn't THE solution according to anyone, it's a step. Part of a greater overall vision. Is it your contention that this is her only policy proposal? If not, then I don't understand why you think anyone believes it's THE solution in and of itself. You list this one detail of her plans, then counter with twenty of Andrews.

This isn't a tech solution, this is a market solution. Companies like amazon, facebook, and google have made too many sectors anti competitive. There's a reason we don't allow monopolies in this country, and that's the reason we need to break them up. Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur, he should understand that

Andrew Yang's opinions on automation are apocalyptic and hyperbolic *at best*. Maybe if the unemployment rate wasn't in the 3% range his message would have more impact. I simply don't buy his urgency to transition to UBI as if all jobs are disappearing. His message is not new, it's been around for many decades, and we're still waiting for the jobs to disappear. Automation is a problem, but Yang makes it out to be a far greater and far more present threat than it actually is. If you want to do some more light reading, check out this informative paper [https://research.upjohn.org/up\_workingpapers/287/](https://research.upjohn.org/up_workingpapers/287/).

UBI is a non-solution, especially the way Andrew Yang implements it. Making people choose between existing welfare benefits and UBI punishes the most vulnerable, and essentially privatizes the social safety net. I'm NOT ok with that. Ever. The UBI discussion has merit, but Andrew Yang is not the man to lead that charge.

Regardless, UBI would require us to double the amount of money the federal government takes in. It would require it to pass congress and it would require it to pass a conservative supreme court. None of these will happen, so it's a non-solution. It's fine to talk about it as a potential future to aspire to, while laying down a path to get there, but Yang's commitment to this policy makes him look more than a tad ignorant. And his willingness to expend political capital on it makes him look naive. Not to mention passing a tax increase of that magnitude would cost enough votes that we'd get steamrolled in the midterms, and set us back decades.

It's fine to talk about your fantastic vision, but back it up with a real path forward. Or, at the very least, make sure your vision is well thought out. Andrew Yang doesn't do either of these.

Secondly, I don't think what we need is more money in politics. Wrong direction. Thirdly, did he pull the $100 number out of a hat? He realizes our mathematical system is in base 10, right? That would mean over 32 billion additional dollars will go towards campaigns. The amount of adults in this country times 100. That's a mind bogglingly insane figure, and just goes to show he doesn't actually know math, despite his jokes. $10 would be more than enough to fund presidential campaigns AND state ones, it just doesn't sound as catchy to his supporters.

3. Don't talk as if geo-engineering is ready to go, with well understood environmental impacts. I think attaching untested and unproven science to a plan that needs universal support is ignorant and dangerous. I can't support Andrew if he'll jeopardize the planet like this. We need to take action *now*. We need to pass legislation *now*.

4. Once again, this is just a straw man argument. No one is talking about GDP as if it is the end all be all, but it is a useful metric to measure economic growth. We also have a happiness index. He's not ahead of the curve, he's decades behind. You're not only allowed to have *one* metric.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Once again, this shows a lack of research. Elizabeth Warren is one of the *best* at working with republicans, and her record reflects that. Probably because, as a former republican herself, she understands them better than most. Here's an [article](https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2019/04/29/elizabeth-warren-republicans) that details her accomplishments across the aisle.

166,"Really great summary of the current state of the discussion. Here are the arguments in favor/against for those who don't want to register:

&gt; Culled from the posts linked above and a few other places, here are summaries of the arguments in favour and against, as we see them.

&gt; **In favour**

&gt; * Contrary to economic theory, a number of economists have found that raising the minimum wage doesn’t lead to lower employment in the real world. The UK is one example.

&gt; * This is partly because of search frictions and therefore lower turnover: a higher minimum wage makes it relatively costlier for an employee to quit and seek another job.

&gt; * The minimum wage in the US has declined through the years when adjusted for inflation (so it has been higher during periods of robust employment) and is also one of the lowest minimum wages as a share of the median wage (so it is higher in some countries with labour markets which are in no worse shape than that of the US).

&gt; * Minimum wage workers are very likely to spend their higher wages, and therefore this legislation would provide a macroeconomic stimulative jolt.

&gt; * By not raising the minimum wage, many lower-income workers will have to seek government benefits of some kind anyways, and therefore the cost (so to speak) of not raising the wage will be passed on to the taxpayer. Furthermore, the prevailing economic conditions have eroded the bargaining power of these workers, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation. A minimum wage would restore some of the balance in their relationships with employers.

&gt; * Yes, it would be inflationary, but that’s great: broad-based, wage-driven inflation is exactly what the economy needs right now.

&gt; **Against**

&gt; * Consistent with economic theory, a number of economists have found that raising the minimum wage leads to lower employment in the real world.

&gt; * Even if search frictions rendered the preceding statement incorrect, it’s not at all clear that fewer quits, or lower turnover generally, is a good thing.

&gt; * About the stimulus effect: 1) Economists disagree on this as well, 2) The higher cost would be passed on to customers who use the products of companies paying a higher minimum wage, and who also were likely to have spent that marginal dollar, and 3) There is evidence that in the past, the additional spending brought by the higher wages was fuelled by correspondingly higher indebtedness, which is not to be encouraged.

&gt; * This is not a period of impressively rising wages and productivity generally, and thus employers are less likely to believe that the workers they hire at above-market wages, ie the minimum wage, are likely to grow into their wages. Thus the likelihood of a bigger unemployment effect is higher than it used to be. (This is uniquely Tyler Cowen’s point.)

&gt; * As a boost to lower-income workers, it isn’t very cost-effective when compared against other ideas. Matthews writes: “According to a 2007 study by the CBO, an increase in the minimum wage to $7.25, like that eventually passed that year, would increase wages by $11 billion, of which $1.6 billion went to poor families. By contrast, increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for large families (as happened in the stimulus bill) and for single people would cost $2.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion would go to poor families.”

(Although I don't like the ""consistent with economic theory/contrary to economic theory"" framing. Both are consistent! It depends on which model of the labor market you are using).

***

Conclusion:

&gt; We think it’s perfectly reasonable to be conflicted about this issue, which is another way of saying that we’re conflicted about this issue. That a modest federal wage increase wouldn’t have much of an employment effect is entirely believable. And while its stimulative potential is dubious, a higher wage would bring needed relief to struggling low-income workers.

&gt; Still, we could be wrong, and this kind of intervention is something to be cautious about, even if it would only be a very small lurch in the direction of a more-calcified labour market. It’s just not clear to us which of the above sets of arguments is stronger.

&gt; For the same reasons that a basic minimum income would be an improvement on the patchwork of extant safety-net provisions — less complicated, less likely to bring about unintended consequences, directly targets poverty and inequality rather than treating one of their symptoms — we think that a redistributive, post-outcome transfer mechanism would probably be better than a minimum wage hike. A basic income, wage subsidies, and a more-generous earned income tax credit all seem like superior alternatives.

&gt; But none of those alternatives is legitimately on the table, while many states continue to raise their minimum wages and general support for the idea is building.

&gt; So what’s the right stand to take on the minimum wage in the absence of a better idea that’s politically feasible?

&gt; Honestly, we don’t know.

1. Set up a Federal Negative Income Tax, shift the various federal outlays being used for ""Welfare"" to this and we come really close to completely closing the gap between the market wage earned by those under the poverty line &amp; what they would collectively need to be above the poverty line. This by itself could pretty much end income based poverty in America. 
2. Make a real federal and state level effort to reform tax rates &amp; regulations to emphasis economic growth &amp; making it much easier for companies to hire people. This is the hardest and most complex step but just things like eliminating the minimum wage, reducing business taxes (especially for small businesses), and getting rid of a lot of the state level licensing nonsense would be huge strides in the right direction. 

So if the Negative Income Tax was basically that a person gets a quarterly check for existing but that check is just enough to survive, but if he gets a job then the combined NIT and salary rapidly get him above the poverty line with the NIT going away somewhere between 120% - 150% of poverty line. Getting a job is much, much easier now but no one really HAS to take a job because they can get by on the NIT if they had too. So it won't be wage slaves working for $0.50 an hour doing back breaking labor, it would be things like my Father-in-law who has to volunteer his time since his age &amp; disabilities make him unemployable currently but if it was cheap &amp; easy for Home Depot to hire him for $3 an hour to sit in the lawn &amp; garden section answering peoples questions about a subject he is very knowledgeable in everyone would be better off.

I have never understood why people who support the UBI don't support a NIT as step 1 in that direction.

226,"That's a really good question.

&gt;Should the government become the lender of last resort?

Yes, and not even a lender, but a donator. That's what it would mean to have a truly progressive-left tax system. Assume that every person of working age will be entitled to a basic income and a minimum guaranteed wage for full-time work, and then structure your tax brackets and other taxations strategies in order to pay for it.

But for the fact that many wealthy would evacuate the country along with all their contributions toward our economy rather than pay their fair share is really the only reason why this sort of solution won't be implemented any time soon, even if the people in power actually want it (which they don't).

We know fairly well, psychologically, that having access to the bare necessities does not make one unwilling to contribute and be productive - quite the opposite. Some people may never contribute, but they will be a manageable minority. Most people though want to feel and be valuable.

I believe convincing enough high income earners that a nation of happy and healthy people is in their best interests as much as those such systems would support. We need to convince them that achieving a UBI and GMI is the most important societal objective of our time, perhaps in our entire history, for the sake of our survival as a species, I would go so far as to say.

It all ties in with the other major existential challenges like pandemics, nuclear war, climate change, and so on. There is enough wealth and resources out there to support 10 billion people and beat climate change. It's just... capitalism selects for sociopaths and narcissists to become the most wealthy and influential people, so change in this direction is really really hard.

So what do we do in the meantime?

I think we want to avoid both tier 2 and tier 3 at all costs, because 2 and 3 are probably connected more often than not. I can't imagine they just let you walk away after defaulting on them. I mean you could be already bankrupt. It's my understanding that they still require collateral at the very least, often to be left with them. They double as pawn shops I believe. So people are giving up prized family ear looms or their only means of transportation and such.

We should make the current welfare system much more accessible. Start people's benefit payments first, and ask questions later. If it turns out they're not entitled to any amount of the funds they were given, turn those funds into interest free loans to be paid back with future earnings (just like the student loan already is). Eventually this could be worked into being a first incarnation of a UBI to simplify the process and reduce the stigma around receiving money from the government (because now everyone gets it), but this must be accompanied by increases in the upper tax rates, wealth taxes, capital gains taxes, and so on.",Taxonomy: Economic systems.,gwn8wpc,"I've given this some thought in the context of money lending. 

Tier 1 lenders would be banks, but they require security and credit history. So, not everyone can get loans from them. The are heavily regulated.

Tier 2 lenders would be payday loan companies. They don't require security or credit history. They have much larger interest rates to offset the increased risk they take on. This is often seen as predatory and immoral.

People don't like Tier 2 and government talks about regulating them more which would probably make their business model unworkable.

However, if you get rid of Tier 2 you and people can't get loans from Tier 1 then they will have to go to Tier 3. 

Tier 3 lenders require even less security and have higher interest rates. If you don't pay they kill you so they have higher risk to offset.

They are impossible to regulate because they are illegal to start with. As long as there have been people there have been desperate people, but getting rid of Tier 2 would probably see them expand.

So what do you do? Should the government become the lender of last resort? You are going to loose some money because if these people were good risks they would be borrowing from banks. Practically this seems like the best solution, but politically it seems unacceptable.

Greseala de abordare la UBI e ca toata lumea se gandeste la orasele mari. UBI nu va fi niciodata super semnificativ in Bucuresti sau Paris. Efectul lui va fi imediat in zonele rurale sarace.

 - pensionarii care castiga mai mult

 - zona din provincie care are venit in plus
 
 - venitul vine intr-un mod 100% capitalist - localnicii sunt obligati sa se organizeze in firme profitabile ca sa castige banii respectivi. Ai in sfarsit activitate economica in Vaslui

 - mai putine fonduri catre somaj pentru zonele respective

 - mai putine subventii pentru pensionarii care pleaca din Bucuresti (numai transportul e zeci de lei pe luna)

 - incarcare mai mica pe serviciile ne-scalabile din oras (transport, sistem sanitar de sarbatori, locuinte etc)

 - eficienta mai mare la nivelul sistemului - poti asigura servicii pentru batrani mult mai ieftin in Mehedinti decat in Bucuresti


Pana si costurile efective cu mutarea sunt practic negative: preturile locuintelor si ale chiriilor sunt extraordinar de favorabile mutarii.

for a tax system to be good in my opinion. it has to fulfill these two criteria:

1. Tax people on what they take and not on what they make.
2. Everyone must derive equal benefit from the tax revenue.

So an example of a good system is tax revenue collected via land value taxes and pigouvian taxes and redistributed to everyone as a citizens dividend or UBI.

234,"It depends on how it's implemented. If the UBI comes from taxation, then it's simply a wealth redistribution. There may be a benefit to simplifying the whole welfare system, in terms of saving money on beurocracy. But at the same time, now someone with a disability is on the same level as someone who is young and healthy, and the redistributive advantage that this person got (AKA disability allowance) is gone. If we keep all these special payments, then we lose the benefit of eliminating beurocracy. We might as well just keep the present system, but just increase the dole and take away time-limits.

The incentive system of welfare is what makes these programs fail. Under the current welfare system, if you do better, your welfare is taken away from you so you're incentivized to do worse. Under the Freedom Dividend, you get $1000 no matter what as long as you're an American adult. There are no strings attached (it's not even taxed). People in these systems can either take the $1000 or stay in their welfare system and collect the difference –nobody will have anything taken from them. The Freedom Dividend means is you can transcend the welfare system. You can slowly save up and get out of your situation instead of wallowing in it. 


&gt;I think when situations get bad enough for people and their families, they pull themselves up and work. 


[Close to 80% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/09/shutdown-highlights-that-4-in-5-us-workers-live-paycheck-to-paycheck.html) American families are working hard and it's not enough. Wages have stagnated since the Boomer glory years. The Freedom Dividend isn't supposed to be a silver bullet that makes our problems all go away. Yang acknowledges this. He believes it will alleviate the economic/mental stress most Americans face because of the cost of healthcare, home prices, rent, student loans, aging parents, car repairs, child care, etc. It will also create a boost in national and local economies. Think of how many people put off things because of no cash flow. I had to put off numerous house repairs. My coworker is waiting for his raise before getting braces for his kid. Most of the Freedom Dividend will go right back into the economy (which would be a godsend for small rural communities).


People think the [Finland study on UBI](http://fortune.com/2019/02/08/basic-income-finland-employment/) was a failure because it didn't make people more incentivized to work. But I consider it a success because it improved people's well-being and were ""no better or worse than the control group at finding employment in the open labor market"" which means it didn't make them lazier which is an attack that critics of UBI will use.

&gt;Along with feeling healthier and less stressed, the recipients of the basic income said they felt more confident about their futures and their ability to find employment, said the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela,) which ran the experiment. The subjects also felt that the system for claiming benefits was less bureaucratic under the experimental system.


Yang doesn't believe in a minimum $15 wage because he is an entrepreneur and believes this will destroy small businesses, which are the ""backbone of America"" according to Yang.

If you replace workers with AI where do they go for jobs? I think they'd rather keep their jobs then be eligible for $12,000 a year. Also- taxing the 1% (1/3 of 4 trillion is 1.333Trillion). On top of their current tax bracket- They'll just leave. Like all of them fleeing New York and California for Florida and Texas. 

I think when situations get bad enough for people and their families, they pull themselves up and work. Handing out essentially free money won't inspire people to work. The average fast food worker makes $18,500 a year. Even if Universal Income is only for those making under $20,000 a year-Add a extra $12,000 on top- you're giving people $30,500 a year or $15.25 an hour.

A lot of them do. Like I support andrew yang and am HUGE on UBI. But all I see from socialists is constant ****ting on the idea because it isnt the equivalent of seizing the means of production. Everything with these people is god dmaned socialism. if it isnt socialism, it's crap, it's trash, it's a neoliberal plot to preserve capitalism. Huge issue i have with the bernie camp despite also describing myself as a bernie supporter. That said socialism kind of leaves a bad taste in my mouth. i'm not for the most extreme forms of it, and workplace democracy, while it would be an improvement, isnt a catch all to me. 

&gt;Also I hate to be that guy

yeah you kind of are.

&gt; but I'm pretty sure there are thousands of examples of succesful ""market socialist"" (really just worker co-ops) around the world.

Sure, it's a functional business model.

I just dont believe democratizing work places solves issues involving the tyranny of power imbalances in the marketplace. Like, sure, it means decisions are made democratically, which might improve things. But it doesnt remove the tyranny that exists in the market place. Competitive pressures might continue to force people to work long hours for bad pay just to stay in businesses, you might literally get better results from labor laws and unions in some cases. And again, as a UBI supporter, my worldview is fundamentally anti work actually.

Like the problem is the labor movement...is they still romanticize labor. Capitalism does lead to wage slavery, but socialists are just like, well, we fixed it, work is fair now because workers own the means of production, things are all better now comrade.

Uh, I literally think UBI and medicare for all might get better results because they liberate people from being tied to work places in the first place. And that could arguably have just as if not more of a transformative effect than being one of 10000 owner-employees in a company. Like market socialism doesnt solve the internalization of the protestant work ethic and all of the cultural issues associated with our society that make work so toxic in the first place. And honestly, the markets are still gonna fail people at times even if employees all are part owners of companies. Owning the means of production doesnt mean crap if the company culture is so toxic and cliquey that i hate being there in the first place. And honestly, long term I'd rather abolish work as a concept in general. I hate the idea of work. I just see it as a massive waste of a life and a distraction from other things that matter more. It's a necessary evil that we work, and we should work to live but instead we live to work. And as I said I feel like socialists romanticize labor a bit too much.

Just because i have anti capitalist vibes in my worldview, doesnt mean that i have a socialist solution to those things. Not to say market socialism cant help, but it's only one small solution of a much larger paradigm shift that needs to happen. And to me socialism is just too old timey to really 'get it.""

And if you think it's worthless to give people money even if they aren't in poverty, keep in mind that over 2/3 of economic growth comes from consumer spending. And that's something that I believe Republicans can also get behind.

When UBI is paired with the value added tax, financial transactions tax, carbon tax, it becomes a wealth redistribution - The biggest and wealthiest consumers of our economy would be paying the most into funds that get allocated to everyone else.

And I wish I understood Yang's healthcare policies more, what I really want him to do is take a stand on the single-payer system and clear up whether or not he supports getting a majority of Americans onto Medicare. I have heard different versions of this, even on his own website he quoted himself on JRE saying, ""We need to get Healthcare off the backs of businesses and families and move towards a single-payer medicare-for-all system"". It's strange to me that he is unclear on this and I think it's the weakest part of his healthcare policy. Everyone looks around the world and sees better healthcare that use a single payer system so we all would want that. For someone like Yang who takes lessons from other countries to support VAT but doesn't make a clear stand on a single payer system is inconsistent to me.","['Public services and healthcare', 'Taxes', 'Non-UBI government welfare programs', 'Economic systems']",fgpc5we,,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
241,"Yeah, why actually do work when you can just say ""tax the rich to fix it""

You assume all wealth is money, liquid funds.

It isn't.  Jeff Bezos is worth like 192 billion. He holds about 17 billion in stock with Amazon.  That's not cash. We can't just take fractions of Amazon and pay for UBI.  Somewhere around 171 billion of his net worth is in public assets like that already.

He allegedly has like $2 billion in cash, in the most generous estimates.

So let's presume you wanna tax money that he's already paid income taxes on, just for fun.  What percent do we tax him, per month, to fund UBI?  There's roughly 330 million people in America.  Let's pretend for sake of argument Bezos has 6 billion in cash he could just hand out tomorrow.

That's $20 per person, period. Elon is probably in the same boat.

So now we've got one month of UBI, if we literally take all the cash from the richest two people, if the basic income is $40.  Let's expand that to $1,000.

We would need cash equivalent to 50 Jeff Bezos for just one month. The top 1% of people average $500k/year. Let's estimate there's around 1 million of these people.

That's $500 billion dollars, give or take. Remember how 6 billion only got us $40 in one month? 

With the entire top 1%, we could last maybe a few years at $40/month before the top 1% didn't exist, and then we'd need the next 10-20% total income to feed that $40, and then a few years after the program would have bankrupted the entire country as everyone starts paying their own $40/month on top of all the other taxes they pay.

Human monkey brains aren't great at conceptualizing these things.

Taxing the rich won't work it.

Printing more money will not work.

243,"&gt; Behind the scenes, Geithner enlisted President Obama to exert pressure on Merkel and other European leaders to mimic some of the steps that the United States had taken in 2008, encouraging them to create a proper bailout fund and turn the European Central Bank into an effective crisis fighter. The pressure didn’t work. 

The Fed should have given Greece an unlimited currency swap line, as it had given the ECB.

&gt; As a result, the general expectation is that, were another crisis to occur, governments (and taxpayers) would again step into the breach. 

How did taxpayers suffer from 2008 bailouts? TARP was paid back with interest and the Fed's liquidity provisioning debited no taxpayer. Trump cut taxes. How did taxpayers pay for any of the bailout? We should acknowledge that taxes were not needed to rescue the world financial system in 2008 and after. Why do we need taxes to fund basic income?

&gt; If the economy falters, or if interest rates rise sharply, many corporations may find themselves in the position of new mortgage holders a decade ago—unable to repay or roll over their debts.

That isn't what caused the crisis, because the lenders had taken out insurance. It was the immature insurance piece that caused a panic, not the mortgage debt itself.

&gt; who believes that an unleashed financial sector is good for anybody but financiers?

Finance can be disconnected from provisioning of real goods and services. Panics in the financial sector do not have to cause shortages. The only resource shortage in 2008 was of money, and the Fed printed (digitally) enough to satisfy the private financial sector's demand.

&gt; the fragile cross-party coalition that took shape in September, 2008, in order “to hold the United States together and provide the underpinnings for the global stabilization efforts of the Fed and the Treasury.” 

If you read the [transcript of the September 16, 2008 Federal Open Market Committee meeting](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20080916meeting.pdf), they don't sound fragile:

&gt; Page 17:

&gt; MR. LACKER. But we will communicate a program size?

&gt; MR. DUDLEY. I think that remains to be discussed with our counterparties. I think we need to have discussions about what would be most effective. Would a big size that’s fixed in quantity be most effective? Would an open limit be most effective? I think we have to have those discussions. I think the important thing here - and what we’re going for - is credibility. In a crisis you need enough force - more force than the market thinks is necessary to solve the problem - and we’re going to have to have discussions to determine how much is enough force. 

Why not acknowledge publicly they were right? And that we can fund basic income using the Fed's balance sheet, too?","- Money and inflation

244,"I agree with you entirely. But that isn't the point of this article or the ""bullshit"" roles idea. They are saying everyone should receive basic income and then you wouldn't have to take a job that you think is below you or doesn't fulfill your creative instinct just to make money.

253,"I don't think UBI will work out well. A person used to have her work power, was able to trade that for a living wage. But now, she will have nothing to offer. That tips the balance of power. From equal partners in a work contract, people now become dependents. Moreover, corporations are greedy and government corrupt. They can't leave their lives at the mercy of the state and corporations.

Instead of UBI, I think it will be essential to develop individual and local self reliance. Start with farms, small factories and services - these can be manned by unemployed people who could produce all their needs by their own power. They could use automation as well to make it almost effortless. Then people would not be left outside the automation revolution and would not need UBI. Instead of UBI, the government could provide subsidised access to construction materials and automation equipment. That would be cheaper than to keep the whole population as useless dependents.

In order to achieve economic bootstrapping, a number of technologies need to be perfected, including solar power, 3d printing and CNC-ing with advanced materials, battery technology, water filtration, efficient automated farming and a few more. We need to find efficient and ecological solutions that scale, and to organize people in such a way as to support each other.

But as we all know, this revolution will occur *much* faster than jobs will be created, and even if new jobs are created, they're going to be specialized and require high levels of education - jobs certainly not for the laborers they're making unemployable.

As more and more companies realize they can get higher returns by making bets on abstract indexes such as GDP, inflation, the stock market, the weather, who will win the Oscars, or whatever, selling widgets will become less important as a source of profit. A company can produce enough real goods for high-end customers and ignore the low-value customers, because they can make bets on the weather or whatever, hedge them, and come out ahead no matter what. Or a company can bet on inflation then raise its prices to seed inflation. Or a company can bet on GDP going down then produce less to make GDP go down.

etc. etc. for all other myriad benefits.

282,"&gt;  The problem is that people see the ads and go to them. And they aggressively recruit

Okay... so the for-profit school system suffers from issues with advertising... and you're probably aware that advertising increases decision utility without affecting experienced utility... So... sure... the problem comes down to advertising again... which I kind of ruled out in this case.

&gt; You haven't known junkies, I'm guessing. 

Probably more than you actually... in fact... most of my closest friends over the last several years are drug addicted street workers... so... actually pretty familiar with the problems of both drugs and prohibition... I'm a part time ametture pimp... headed to court in half an hour with one of my girls who was thrown half an 8-ball by her dealer after a car chase and told to swallow it and now on trial for possession and supply of class-A substance... but actually looking at the facts I don't see how that can stick.

Actually pure heroin* has little affect on your kidney's or liver... there's little evidence of long term brain damage... and most of the problems you talk about repair after long term abstinence. of course repository (EDIT: LOL, I meant respiratory) collapse is a danger... but mostly for users who've been off for a long time and do their normal dose, which they no longer have tolerance for... or because of unknown and changing purity... the latter easily fixed in a legalised framework... and nalaxone (which should be made available) immediately reverses these effects. Maybe sexual issues are a health problem... I don't think that's a big issue... but sure... but the only real health problems are the gastrointestinal and addiction...

Adulterants in street heroin do cause brain damage, heart, kidney and liver damage in addition to the above dangers... and while heroin withdrawal is incredibly painful... it does not cause brain damage and will not kill you like alcohol withdrawal does. I'd rather be addicted to (pure and measured) heroin than alcohol.

&gt; But it is only pareto efficient.

Yeah sure... clearly I was simplifying there... free markets lead to pareto efficient optimal allocations... No one can be made better off without making someone else worse off... You're a 100% right on that fact... but everything else leads to less than pareto optimal allocations... ie, it is not as good even given the limitations of the pareto allocation... because people could be made better off without making anyone else worse off... but drug use is not the place to fix that... the place to fix that lies in wealth redistribution, which is another topic altogether (though quickly, the actual answer to that is wealth taxes and basic income... but I digress).

EDIT* : I have no idea about the effects of oxycontin... which could be significantly different, especially if injected.","- Public services and healthcare
- None of the above",cw9iqt3,"&gt; you only go to them if you couldn't get into a better school in the first place, right?

No.  This is a big problem with for-profit education.  They advertise more than anybody else.  So if you ever watch TV you see ads for U Phoenix or Grand Canyon U or ITT Tech or Gibbs or other for-profit colleges.  The problem is that people see the ads and go to them.  And they aggressively recruit and accept everyone from the moment you contact them.  Shareholders don't want them to be choosy.  They want more profit.  So recruiters call day and night until you enroll.

For profit colleges accounted for only 12% of the total post-secondary enrollment in 2010, but accounted for more than half of all student loan defaults and more than 80% of all unsubsidized private loans.

There are serious problems with them.


&gt;actual pure heroin doesn't cause many problems beyond addiction and constipation by the way

You haven't known junkies, I'm guessing.  But there are major kidney and liver complications for high users (just like alcohol), serious respiratory depression and risk of respiratory system failure (lots of people die this way), neuropathy and other degenerative neurological conditions come out of it (it takes the pain away but also fucks the nerves up), this can result in seizures, sexual issues (difficult to achieve orgasm, etc), plus chronic constipation and other gastrointestinal issues.

All smooth muscle and other involuntary processes slow down, not just the gut.  

Chronic use fucks you up bad.  It happens if you are using pure oxycontin pills or street smack.  

&gt;the free market remains the most efficient means of allocation and maximising utility for everyone

No.  That was never what it was supposed to do.  It was supposed to maximize aggregate utility.  But it is only pareto efficient.  The market **absolutely does not** lead to maximized utility *for everyone*.

That was the whole purpose of [Armatya Sen's Nobel Lecture.](http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~damani/ctaraReading/AmartyaSenSocialChoice.pdf)..the prize itself was for explaining mathematically why this is not so.

Even perfectly efficient markets, which only exist as a hypothetical construct, can absolutely be incredibly inequitable.  It is perfectly Pareto Efficient and in line with maximizing utility for the US GDP to double and every single cent of it to go to Bill Gates.  Nobody has to get anything ever for something to be pareto efficient, only one person has to get *more*.

Apparently I'm the only one that has, given people in here are balking at a points based system that has existed for years.

&gt; How high should the bar be set before a person is entitled to receive welfare? At what level of disorganisation, inability or incompetence should a person be that it becomes okay to let them starve? Is it they do not deserve to eat is what you are trying to say?

If you cannot meet your obligations after adjustments (I know you haven't been on Jobseeker, but your points cap and mutual obligation changes based off of circumstance) then you will be given a demerit not taken off of your payment straight away. 

If you cannot apply for 10 jobs via Seek or your Jobseeker dashboard, where you literally only need to click three or four times to autofill all of the information and get it put into your record, then you should get in touch with a medical professional because you may have cognitive issues that would qualify you for a disability pension.

&gt; Perhaps you'll accept these alternative definitions of the theorems?

Yes, I will accept these ''alternative definitions'' (lol) but the point still stands - why are we fixated on them? Is it because something being called a fundamental theorem sounds very important to you? Also heads up for future discussions where you talk out of your depth - saying ''describe the fundamental theorems'' is a meaningless question without further definition, there are fundamental theorems in a lot of different fields. I'm used to talking to people fresh into education, but most people will not be qualified to pick up what you are putting down.

&gt; Notice a UBI is a non-distortionary lump sum transfer which suggests we can have a pareto efficient market where no one lives in poverty?

A UBI wouldn't create a perfect market and in order to achieve a perfect market (hypothetically) would require government intervention, which unto itself would be an externality.

&gt;Your right, we should ignore these regarding public policy simply because no one uses them. Why not just go back to outright slavery? I'd certainly make a buck with a few slaves.

The fundamental theorems of welfare economics aren't important to public policy because they are isolated from the reality of domestic and international markets, students going through university learn modern macro and political economics so that they can engage with policy creation or analysis instead of lionizing old theories because they sound cool to laymen like you.

No idea how we got from ''this theory is old and has been in disuse for years'' to ''we need to own slaves'' but that is an interesting leap, I guess. Theorems are meant to solve for calculation problems not exist as complex economic platforms, normative positions (like pro- or anti-slavery) handle social expectations and standards. The age of the theorem is relevant because it is not utilized by people seeking to solve problems through policy, slavery is an odd comparison given being anti-slavery has been a mainstream position for 100 years.

&gt; It certainly is relatively new given it hasn't been tried anywhere as an actual universal basic income.

The completed theorem is nearly as old as our modern conception of a hybridized market, this is not ''relatively new.'' This is a silly hill to die on. If you want to engage with the public policy field, I can make some university suggestions for your state or territory and you can start an undergrad.

Perhaps you'll accept these alternative definitions of the theorems?

1) When the assumptions of the free market are met, the market will reach a pareto optimal equilibrium allocation meaning no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off, and conversely, when the assumptions of the free market are not met the market will not reach a pareto optimal equilibrium allocation meaning some people could have been better off without anyone being worse off.

Where the assumptions are perfect competition, perfect information, no externalities, and rational actors.

2) When the assumptions of the first are met, any pareto optimal equilibrium allocation can be achieved with lump sum transfers.

Would you accept those definitions?

I also think that modern Western capitalism is tied up in exploitation because of timing and context (if we had been socialist for some reason then exploitation would be baked-in to whatever socialist society we would have formed as well I think because of our heritage of empire and colonialism. To avoid exploitation we would have had to do that all differently, which I see as unlikely either way), but capitalism I think compounds the issue. I would say I'm opposed to ""socialism,"" but I still think we need a hefty dose of it (but slowly and democratically and one policy at a time). 

Trade can certainly lift countries out of poverty, but it has only hurt the vast majority of them. This is unfortunate because at this point they don't have a choice *but* to trade, and most third world countries can't even form a cohesive identity because they're living so day-to-day that they have no concept of the borders colonies forced on them or a concept of a nation or what it's supposed to do. Those lucky enough to pull themselves together (or have the culture that provides identity) certainly are boosted, the rest are damaged and unable to recover because colonization introduced new culture and erased a lot of identity that may have been building.

I think that eventually, though, technology (and leftist thinking) will gradually pull us towards more socialist policies (such as UBI, but I think that won't occur until we have a little data revolution or something where we're openly acknowledging as a society that data is valuable and powerful, and I don't just mean in the way that people think the internet is cool and important right now.

306,"I think we are mostly in agreement. The only places I see a difference are:

1 - In eliminating bullshit jobs, I think the biggest thing is to not have large institutions deciding top-down what a lot of the work will be. It's easier for them to mis-allocate workers, than when workers are picking for themselves in the case of things like small businesses, volunteering, or just free time. IMO paying people the basics to exist will lead to a lot of people doing the care work you talk about without the government (or private sector) as a middle man. Where that fails, is that large projects like infrastructure, big science, etc. won't be done without large-scale institutions. That's where we need them.

2 - Disability pays out regularly similar to UBI, but has a big difference. It locks the person into limited productivity. It traps them in not working, volunteering, etc. That means that it is not universal. You can't get it while being productive, so it's means tested. That keeps it from having the correct effect it should on the labor market and on home-scale innovation.",Labor wages and work conditions.,gceocpr,"That's a great point I always try to make - we already have a federal jobs program called the U.S. military. We just spend that money enriching contractors and rebuilding other parts of the globe (after we blow it up) rather than spending that money rebuilding an infrastructure that in some places (in terms of electricity) dates back to Thomas Edison. Our broadband access is third-world level. China built a high-speed rail network connecting their country in just over a decade even as our roads and highways have fallen apart, and their country is just as vast as ours.

I don't know if I would link it to just infrastructure, though. There are a lot of things that need doing in this country that the private sector simply can't or won't do because it isn't profitable. Everything from caring for the young and old; to teaching; to creating more sustainable agriculture; to community health (imagine if we had enough workers to test and trace in a time of Covid).

Everyone always brings up the Bullshit Jobs argument. But I think Graeber was mostly criticizing this popular notion of the private sector as hyper-efficient and waste-free promoted by market fundamentalists rather than arguing that all government jobs are by nature pointless busywork. The other argument for it is that--unlike UBI--it's been done before: The Works Progress Administration and the Civilian Conservation Corps. These were a lifeline to many people during the Great Depression. People forget that artists and writers were employed as well (Dorthea Lange was employed by the [Farm Security Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Security_Administration)).

Puerto Rico does not allow you to grow, TN should though. Something like grow up to 10 plants, then $1,000 / 100 plants tax after that.

If you legalize pot, remember you get to remove tons and tons of other taxes... it's an insane revenue stream to a city...

TN could do a UBI thing with the money, give $300 / month to everyone under 25 - with child payments going to parents, in addition to whatever else they get already. That would be a great way to ensure government doesn't grow while allocating that tax to a good purpose, the poeples.

327,"Actually that UBI is not connected to CPI is an inherent weakness as the cost of living rises, making UBI obsolete. Whereas NIT can easily be set to adjust for this, Yang simply does not do this. 

NIT is stable in that we KNOW everyone will be above the poverty line, $1000/mo ain't shit. Especially considering he doesn't support medicare for all, free college, rent control, or a raise in the minimum wage. 

VAT it is a major problem in Yang's model and economists point this out, and no literally not everyone benefits from UBI, especially not the poor.

Does it add up, though? The estimated cost of a $1000/month UBI for adults in the US is expected to be ~$3tn annually [1], [2]. Let’s see if the numbers add up:

Current spending: $500-$600bn

VAT: $800bn

New revenue: $500-$600bn

Saved spending on incarceration etc.: $100-$200bn

That adds up to $1.9-$2.2tn. That’s a stark difference from the estimated cost of ~$3tn. So where does the last $800bn-$1.1tn ($950bn median) come from? Debt presumably. And the proposal seems to suggest so in a different section, saying “Our plan for a Universal Basic Income uses mostly money already in the economy [...] Our UBI plan has minimal changes in the supply of money.” $950bn is not a small amount. There are only 4 years of a higher deficits [3]--all in the wake of the financial crisis--and 2018’s deficit of $779bn with $950bn on top would be more than any year in US history. The MMT memes seems strong in this one.

On a VAT: “a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check.” Expecting the VAT to only increase prices marginally, seems very strange. Consumers are expected to bear the majority of tax incidence, see e.g. [4]. I’d also love for Yang to explain why a regressive tax is the preferred way of taxation for something like UBI.

On new revenue: This section is quite egregious in my opinion. “The Roosevelt Institute projected that the economy would grow by approximately $2.5 trillion and create 4.6 million new jobs.” That, however, is a grave misrepresentation of what those estimates are based on [2]. Those estimates are based on financing UBI using debt, which is not what Yang claims to do.

When using the assumption that it is financed by taxation of households, it finds that there is no growth, however when using an assumption of there being a distributional effect, they end up with a much smaller effect than Yang alleges, of 2.62%, or about 1/5th of what is claimed (look at the green ones, not the red ones, Yang!). The same goes for jobs, which is then projected as 1.1m new jobs instead of 4.6 million.

Other issues:

The authors acknowledge that the assumptions of the model are more optimistic compared to other models

The distributional effect is likely weaker for Yang’s proposal as VAT is a regressive tax, while the report uses a progressive tax criteria. This is supported by a comment made by one of the authors, to CBS, where he says a VAT would work in direct opposition to a UBI, and “If the point of the universal basic income is to rectify wage stagnation, poverty, or to have some sort of response to rising inequality, that's great. But if we pay for it with a VAT, you undo all of those gains because you're causing poor people to pay for this, which undermines the argument for why we need a UBI to begin with.” [5]

The distributional effect should be further weakened as the authors use an unconditional cash infusion to households, while Yang proposes that welfare beneficiaries receiving &lt;= $1000 will not receive an extra cash infusion of this amount.

To summarize, it seems like his UBI proposal raises some concerns:

Unprecedented levels of deficits, leading to record-high levels of debt. I haven’t seen Yang actually talk about functional finance, or the implications of such levels of funding by debt (the closest is this implication from his proposal: “The federal government recently printed $4 trillion for the bank bailouts in its quantitative easing program with no inflation.”)

Also, I'm assuming they got paid to teach and that's how they made their living.

&gt;but my mind and purpose could be so much more if I weren't limited

I'm not sure what you mean by that, but if you are so sure and think you can make a living doing it, what is stopping you from pursuing that? If you truly believe that, there's no reason why you can't go do it and be successful.

2) Setting up conditions creates distortions.  Right, you get welfare until you make money from your job.  Huh, people don't want a job so much.  You get money only if you've been a good saver.  Huh, we're exacerbating the problem by giving only wealthy people more money.  UBI just skips this whole issue and avoids creating unnecessary distortions in incentives.

(if you're in the US) we have Roth IRAs which, quickly, are retirement savings accounts that are taxed going in (i.e. you fund it with post-tax money) but the account grows tax-free and the withdrawals are also tax-free. It is completely foolish (and extra doubly so if you assume that people are acting in their strategic best interests) to assume and not have in the back of your mind at least the possibility that 40 years in the future when you're making the withdrawals, the tax regime would have changed so that they are taxed. 

In fact, it's one of the listed points of distinction when deciding between an IRA (pre-tax in, taxed out) and a Roth IRA",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
345,"As a mid-libertarian, I honestly think the best approach is probably a UBI equivalent to the gap between minimum wage + living wage, paid for via corporate taxes.

I don't like the idea of raising the minimum wage because that is going to pinch out workers for whom the market does not value their jobs at a ""living wage"", and lead to unemployment or a move to gray/black market employment for unskilled workers. 

I know progressives like to think doubling the minimum wage thing is great for workers but it will have so many unintended negative consequences in most non-urban regions of the country, will cause severe unemployment for those who need the money the most, and cause small business bankruptcies. It is a political approach by trade unions who have wage contracts pinned to minimum wage, thus forcing up the cost of all labor drastically, which will also cause more unemployment and outsourcing.

There are no physical laws in the social sciences, and nothing is definitively proven. We should still listen to the social science consensus, but making careful arguments against it is fine. It isn't useful to compare it to denying evolution. I'm just trying to see both sides represented fairly in this debate.

I don't think that a negative income tax is antithetical to a universal basic income. The negative income tax is far more similar to the basic income than it is to the labyrinthine system of benefits we have currently. For what it's worth, I actually agree with the point from the first article that the basic income should be tapered. I think that many supporters of the basic income would be fine with that too, though I don't know for sure.

I think we should try a large scale experiment of the basic income or a negative income tax to see if it works. You can't know if something works or not until you have tried it. If it works, then great. If it doesn't work, then that's fine too.","Taxonomy:

Why wait until our need is so dire that the choice is UBI or die? Layoffs are already happening and have been.

Similarly democrats don’t want to face the realities of automation taking jobs because they then have to acknowledge that it wasn’t racism or Russia that got an opponent like Trump elected and was instead a failing on their own part to appeal to rural Americans who were facing hardship and crying out for someone in Washington to see their problems and have their backs.

Even just by paying lip service to the issue of job loss and even while incorrectly shifting most of that blame to jobs going overseas (when the bulk of job loss really did just come down to automation), Trump did more than the democrats did in 2016.

If by ""incentive"" you mean the perception that you'll end up homeless and/or starve if you don't? Well, yeah, fewer people will do something if it's not a matter of life and death, like how some people voluntarily go without sex, but still won't hold their head underwater for more than a couple minutes because they need to breathe.

The need to breathe, however, usually isn't something that stresses people out because despite how vital it is, getting access to oxygen-sufficient air and inhaling/exhaling is easy enough and something people are naturally inclined enough to do that you don't even have to think about it.

Getting a job, though? And then keeping it? That's complicated. And often unpleasant. Yeah, some people might stop working if they didn't have to. The question is not, will some people not work, but will so many people not work that what needs doing doesn't get done? Will enough people who don't have to work for their own income still do so that farms get farmed, plumbing gets fixed, and all the little necessities that society needs doing but aren't something that people take care of individually, get done?

[Maybe if people were offered non-tradeable internet points for their labors that might be enough incentive to keep people sufficiently productive? ;) ]

&gt;You are no longer paid according to your ability or what you produce, you are now paid simply for existing.

Well, for example, if one's suicidal, ""simply existing"" can seem like too much for people to ask of them. That's kinda off-topic, though. But, point being, nobody chose to be here. If we can make people's lives less shitty, then why not?

Also, people could still get jobs and be paid according to their ability - basic income would be in addition to whatever you earn, not instead of. Like, say everyone gets $10,000, or maybe $20,000/year regardless, then whatever they earn on top of that, minus taxes. A lot of people do go for high paying jobs today rather than everybody seeking out minimum wage jobs, why wouldn't that trend of people trying to earn more money than the minimum necessary for survival continue?

Getting a job would be less of a pain in the ass if I wanted extra income,"" not, ""Oh boy, extra money! Raising kids is so easy, it's just like running a puppy mill, only *I* get to be the bitch who gets pregnant and gives birth over and over! How fun!

370,"TL;DR: universal programs would fix inequalities better than programs that target particular groups.

Idk if other liblefts would agree with me, but I personally see it this way. Few issues today are exclusive to a group. Generally, groups will be affected disproportionately by something, like non-white people and poverty, or black people and police violence. 

Because of this, if you have a universal program such as M4A, UBI, defunding the police and funding preventative measures instead, etc. you will automatically disproportionately help those groups - no oppression math necessary. Additionally, universal programs are a better idea practically because they tend to be more liked and are therefore kept functioning better and for longer. 

That said, I'm not claiming that this would automatically lead to some utopia, nor that it would solve all of the inequality in our society, as a number of issues are both cultural and economic, and these programs would only aid in the economic side of things.

I would say the answer in that idealized world wouldn't be no education, but perhaps less strenuous education followed by apprenticeships.",Education and family.,cjjcmd6,"That speech didn't do much for me. At the end of the day, humanities greatest strength is our ability to produce behavior through casual inferences (Just like the speech requested, I did study cognitive psychology).

A causal inference is inferring cause and effect of any given situation without directly triggering or interacting with the situation. This ability is at the heart of all reasoning and is the core of why we are able to learn.  

To completely decry the value of education is to decry the value of what literally makes us human. We are who we are because of a constant and entirely social evolution. This social evolution can only occur through education. Further, even a single generation removed erases this progress from existence. 

Therefore the only way for society to even maintain is to continue the same level of education, and the only way to improve is to improve the education. Its not just about facts, despite his derisive laugh (which really makes me question his own education on the subject), education does indeed teach people how to learn and think. You cannot just say ""okay, humanity has improved enough, lets stop doing everything which got us here and hope the quality of our socially society still gets passed on the future generations without any education.""

You cannot just have a cabal of geniuses who monopolize education, because they do not reflect society. Without that iterative and educational march of progress improving as many individuals as possible, society as a whole will crumble no matter how educated the truly gifted and motivated are.

Society has no option but to regress if the majority of people are not uplifted through education. We have made no permanent process in our species which could not be undone in the blink of an eye. The downside of our rapid progress is the temporal nature of it all. It must be maintained, recreated, and retaught every single generation, in as many children as possible, or its lost. Whether they live comfortably or not, a paycheck alone does not make a modern man.  

Give them the paycheck, and the education. Or else the paycheck will soon be meaningless. The posted argument suffers heavily from relying on a critique of the system in order to critique the absolute value of education. The guaranteed income reasoning makes sense when combined critique the educational system. But to also attack education its self is to throw the baby out with the bath water.

the government used to have $2,222.00 to spend on public services.

It's really neat how you can mathematically show that by giving out money $444.40, the government retains only $1,777.60 to spend on public services.

It's just completely worthless. I mean, the fact that the government is able to retain less and hand out more, or retain more and hand out less -- may look very mathematically elegant and attractive to you, but is not an argument for why the government SHOULD retain less and hand out more.

I asked a series of questions earlier, and it didn't seem to me like you had any coherent answers to those.

 - P3: $100 weekly income ($20 tax)
 - P4: $1000 weekly income ($200 tax)
 - P5: $10,000 weekly income ($2000 tax)

Now let's say one fifth of that 20% tax goes towards everybody's UBI (the other 16% obviously would be for other needs such as infrastructure, police, hospitals etc. etc.).

Total tax = $0+$2+$20+$200+$2000 = $2,222.00. One fifth of that is $444.40 shared among five people is $88.88 per week each. So here are the new incomes adjusted for basic income for everyone:

 - P2: $96.88 weekly income
 - P3: $168.88 weekly income
 - P4: $888.88 weekly income
 - P5: $8,088.88 weekly income

Government weekly income (excluding UBI) for infrastruture, hospitals etc.: $1,777.60

That's just about his image, when it comes to policy I'm relatively fiscally conservative. There's a lot of places to cut spending primarily the military, foreign aid, and oil subsidies. With regards to the military, we should cut back on production of massive aircraft and carriers that we are getting ripped off on anyway.

From your perspective, UBI is a way to combat general wealth inequality and to redistribute some of the wealth considered to be excessively hoarded by the top 1%. In this plan, it is the wealthiest individuals which will fund the program. I understand this position though I'm not sure if it would be beneficial in the long run.

I think of UBI in the context of automation, in which UBI is a solution to inevitable unemployment, and will be funded (at least in part) by the excess value generated from automation.

- Taxes are raised on corporations, but minimum wage requirements are reduced/eliminated.

-  There is no longer a need for a company to be paying unemployment for someone they let go.  Again, easing the new tax burden.

- some of the money is made back by streamlining government.  Instead of having multiple departments and social nets to protect people all being overworked trying to determine if people qualify, and then policing that they aren't scamming us, we can get rid of most of them, and consolidate the others.

- A lot of crime we pay for is due to people feeling desperate about their financial and social standing.  Making sure no one can ever fall that far down will reduce that.

- A lot of people don't start their own companies due to risk.  We would see an influx of innovation and people trying (mostly failing, but some new things) from those of us who can go and pursue a dream.

I get the attraction to giving people the economic base to persue endeavours, but I'm pretty sure that WW1 wiped like 100 years of human progress and wealth off of the map, and no amount of basic income is going to ever undo that!

So, if BI is used as an excuse to keep a state (which by definition violated the NAP), then I (and every libertarian and ancap) would oppose it. I think that's the tension you're always going to get. We could agree on BI as common ground with statists, if there was some guarantee it wasn't being used as an excuse to implant the state permanently in human history :(","Political affiliations, Economic systems.",cmsr49f,freicoin sounds pretty interesting!

427,"Hmmmm..... could be somewhat distorting of the economy.

Might be better to try and run with UBI (Universal Basic Income),
or a more conservative version, NIT (Negative Income Tax).

It could really provide a big boost in poorer regions and account for automation loss. The boost in spending money will help business grow, and deliver prosperity. Very hard to implement though, and going with it would probably require eliminating most existing social assistance programs such as Employment Insurance. Might save money from the efficient streamlining of the system.


Probably set the UBI payment per adult to be roughly equal to average living expenses in a region, with cheaper regions receiving less and more expensive regions receiving more to account for higher expenses of living. Might need some serious oversight. It's an idea worth considering.","- Taxes

431,"While you are correct, there are two aspects to this which point to what I think is Yang's opinion, condensed down into a single tweet.

First, because the federal reserve has the ability to print money, the government could have added to the deficit in order to provide a temporary UBI to people. While true that the government doesn't have the ability to stop the federal reserve from providing this loan to the institutions receiving it, it doesn't stop the government from providing a stimulus that will help negate the impact this coming recession will have. 

Second, this points to a recurring problem. When the economy goes into a recession, our society focuses on helping out businesses rather than helping out the every day American. If you give money directly to businesses, it *might* go down to the workers, but there is no guarantee of that, meaning it very well may not help them out. If you instead provide a stimulus to people, the only place to really spend that money is at a business. We know it will cycle back through, so not only will it provide businesses with additional profits, it allows people who are laid off or otherwise out of work at this time to still afford at least some of the necessities. By spending that money, they also provide businesses with reason to keep employees on since they will still be bringing in revenue, so fewer people should become unemployed.

None of this is to say that your impression of his tweet is wrong. The fact is that tweets can easily be misinterpreted because they don't provide the same ease of explaining an idea because of character limits and the general format of them. Tweet chains can only go so long before they become cumbersome, meanwhile a comment on Reddit can go into great detail because the character limit is very high. However, in light of this, I think it is reasonable to give him the benefit of the doubt that perhaps you misinterpreted what he meant by that. Or, it could also be that he simply was unaware it was the federal reserve doing this directly rather than the government taking on additional spending to pay this out to various institutions. All I would recommend doing is simply take his tweet in the most literal sense and wait to give judgement until you have more context.",Money and inflation.,fkj4fy5,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ok then let me get this straight: wages will be kept down via political (not market) forces; the market thus doesn't meet its desire for labor; there is production shortage; prices go up; and your UBI loses its value anyway.... so those political forces don't even achieve their goal...

Ok.

How about we descend from fiction-land and say ""wages will go up as the market forces want them to, there might some-not-astronomical inflation but anyway the UBI is pegged to inflation so doesn't lose its value, workers end up with more bargaining and higher salaries than before, everyone goes home happy except the rentier class that does not get to exploit labor as it used to and for which all shit they used to buy costs 10% more (&amp; they are thus substantially poorer, overall)""

433,"Yes for higher wages, but automation is an iffy one. High wagers is also only a compromise or transitional policy toward socialism. I personally like syndicalism, but there are many different flavors of socialism with many different ideas on how to liberate the working class. Many people propose a Universal Basic Income as a solution for automation. However, under the current system, such a Basic Income would only create an underclass of people who only receive their basic needs from the state - and have no means of production to actually go beyond their needs.

The adage goes, in a socialist system, automation means vacation. In a socialist system where the workers truly own and control the means of production, the workers will benefit from the profits of automation, rather than the capitalist benefiting from the automated labor. In a capitalist UBI system, the automation benefits the capitalist, who is in turn taxed to provide such UBI for the people. In a socialist system the workers share equally in the profits of their labor, so that automation would directly benefit the workers. Syndicalism is one way that this is implemented, and we see successful syndicates in the worker-coop movement. Basically instead of a vertical hierarchy, where employees low on the ladder work harder for less wages, is replaced with a horizontal hierarchy where you share in the profits relative to your contribution to the company.

438,"I’m not defending Bezos at all but the principle that I can’t quite get across that is a crux to much of this. 

I’m not sure how you don’t see a connection of bezos and his equity. He doesn’t have $100bn in cash. Most if not all is amazon stock ownership. I don’t really track his income or other incentives. But I’d bet it’s all common stock. Anyway...to tax bezos he will sell those shares and literally give up ownership (maybe not control but I don’t know his %) but literally it is giving up control of a company he made and another company could literally own more of amazon. Net worth is ownership and control of a company. I hope you see that. 

It’s why I try and compare it to a home. Your net worth is in a home. Equity in a home. And taxing you on your house value if it’s goes up 10x or 100x is actually what equity is. You don’t have more cash but your house is worth more. You can sell the house or parts of the house. I hope you see it’s not as easy as “let’s just take their money”.  

Instead it arguing for salary etc I think more employees need common stock. It’s far more value-add and fair. 

Golden parachutes are pretty much gone already. Getting that contract today doesn’t exist. 

Anyway. I’m really not trying to argue you against your position. Or to change. I just think some of those major changes are ready. I think UBI and VAT and giving to people vs programs is a much better idea. It’s more libertarian, sure. But it also trusts people directly.",Living costs,fhgdvtq,"&gt; Why must someone be exploited to make money? If a rule applies for millionaire and billionaires then it would apply to anyone, right? 

No.  For the same reason that people with income below the standard deduction do not end up paying taxes, people who have income above really fucking rich levels get taxed more.  That's what progressive taxation is.

&gt;Any business. If that is true then you tax / control one group because they exploit more? I just don’t understand this yet.

So if you have a big company, and your profit margins are reasonable and your employees are well compensated then your company will pay fewer taxes.  If you are making profit hand over fist, giving your failed CEOs 60million dollar golden parachutes and fueling slave labor in other countries then you will pay more in tax.


&gt;I do, basically, subscribe to Taleb’s skin in the game idea. By removing upside you also remove downside.

&gt;Equity and salary are different. It doesn’t matter if your house is worth $100k or $100mn in the case of ownership. It’s yours. You bought it with work. And if you were to give up 51% ownership or control is akin to building up a business and suddenly giving up 51% control...

No one is going after individual people's homes.  They're saying that if your net worth is over 32-50 million dollars you pay an annual 3% or 6% tax (if over 1 billion in net worth) on that wealth.  It's not taking their business away.  It is incentivizing them to distribute their profits in a more equitable way or we will do it for them.  Personally I would like a cap on executive compensation to be a multiplier of what the lowest paid employee in the company makes.  And that's to address this:

https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2019/11/26/u-s-household-incomes-a-50-year-perspective

where the top two quintiles of compensation are pulling away vastly from everyone else in terms of how their income is growing.  

&gt;bashing capitalism is easy. It has many faults. But simply taking billions away from someone in equity/power/ownership also creates other problems.

We give them billions in tax havens to encourage them to open businesses in certain towns.  We give them billions in bank bailouts.  I am fucking tired of people saying that rich people deserve shit because they work hard.  Sure, some of them do.  But Donald Trump?  The Kardashians?  Paris Hilton?  They were born rich.  They had more opportunities because they were rich.  Donald is like I just got a small loan of a million dollars.  Ha ha don, very funny, a vanishingly small number of people have that opportunity, plus he's way underselling the resources he had access to.  I am tired of socialism for capitalists and scraps for everyone else.  It's time for the wealthy and corporations to pay up.  They are nothing without their workers.  If you lay off all the people actually doing work and keep the executives guess what happens, the business would collapse within days or weeks.  Have a vacant exec position or two?  eh, things could keep running for years.  The corporations need the little guy more than the little guy needs them.  And I refuse to believe that one individual, even a brilliant world changing scientist like Stephen Hawking is worth millions or billions of times more than any other individual.  I don't believe that someone's motivation to innovate would be stifled by not being able to accumulate more wealth than they could spend in generations.  Most innovators innovate for the joy of it anyway, and the wealth is a side benefit.  I have never met a single person who is genuinely enthusiastic and passionate about a topic and lucky enough to do it for a career who is in it for the money., 

&gt;How do you propose to take Jeff Bezos billions away and also give him control of the company? 

His personal wealth has nothing to do with the ownership and running of his company.  Personally if I came to acquire enough money that I could live modestly and not have to work for the rest of my life, I'd fucking quit and I think most people would.  I sincerely believe there is something wrong with the people who don't.  Ask any working stiff if they would keep working at their current job until age 67 if handed 10 million dollars and I guarantee you most would be like fuck no I'd quit today, some would be like, I'd put in my notice and work for a few more weeks to ensure a smooth transition, and a handful would be like I'd probably work for a few years until I figured out what I want to do next.  

&gt;And if him...why not every business owner? Again, I think you are inherently taking 51% ownership of small and medium businesses as well as large businesses.

There is no talk of taking ownership of businesses.  Only the taxation of personal wealth and the elimination of decades of corporate socialism enabling the most asinine and excessive levels of executive compensation in the developed world.

&gt;I don’t know the answer. Yes they should pay more. I just don’t think anyone has a great solution except yang. I disagree with warren. And that’s me. Or maybe I don’t understand it yet.

I like a lot of points Yang made.  I do believe that UBI will become necessary at some point in our future as automation takes over more and more of the manufacturing jobs that are accessible to people without a higher education degree.  Without strongly investing in our public schooling, and sometimes not even then, we must accept the fact that not every person is mentally capable of performing adequately in an economy where the majority of low skill jobs are being performed by machines.  Many children could be trained to be better by having excellent and well funded schooling with available treatment and accommodations for learning disabilities and prioritizing academics above football in our schools, by making technical training (like vo tech) and other job training, and college affordable.  UBI is also complicated by the vast differences in cost of living in various areas of the country.  A few hours west of me and you can buy houses for under 20k.  There aren't any jobs there but its cheap as shit.  Meanwhile, a couple hours east and good luck getting a 2 bedroom apartment for less than high 6 figures.   

&gt;Feel free to read Skin in the game by taleb. It’s pretty great.

I'll check it out, thanks for the tip.  But overall, my stance is:

No individual person is worth millions of times more per hour than any other.

Everyone deserves to be able to live in a clean, warm, safe shelter with access to the necessities of life even if they aren't ""productive"".  (which includes modest funds for entertainment and small luxuries).  Almost all of the worst parts of our society have a root cause in poverty.  What drives crime?  Poverty and lack of opportunity.  What drives suicide?  Lack of access to mental health care, and frankly, poverty.  What drives drug addiction?  see above.  What drives abortion? lack of access to medical care, paid sick/vacation/parental leave and fear of not being able to afford a child.  

Our approach to poverty and homelessness is the same as our approach to gun violence ""we've tried nothing and we're all out of ideas"".

This is what has happened since 1978:
&gt;Since 1978, and adjusted for inflation, American workers have seen an 11.2 percent increase in compensation. During that same period, CEO’s have seen a 937 percent increase in earnings. That salary growth is even 70 percent faster than the rise in the stock market, according to the Economic Policy Institute.

Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/22/heres-how-much-ceo-pay-has-increased-compared-to-yours-over-the-years.html

Nothing about that is reasonable.  Executives have been stealing from us for decades.  We just want it back

Everyone deserves health care, parental leave should they choose to have children, affordable childcare where the carers are compensated fairly, paid sick (as well as family sick) and vacation time if they are working (european amounts not 7-10 days like a lot of american companies, fuck that shit)

Everyone deserves access to a high quality education at an affordable cost.

Families who are caring for disabled adult or minor dependents deserve access to respite care, and potentially assistance to recognize that caring for those people has value and it should not bankrupt them.

Everyone should be able to retire with dignity and have access to social security as well as a living wage that allows them to save for retirement on their own.

Everyone deserves a living wage.  If companies like mc Donald's are paying full time workers less than they need to live within a reasonable commuting distance of their employment without relying on federal housing assistance and/or food stamps then our tax dollars are directly subsidizing mc donald's corporate profit.  It's really that simple.  No one should have to work 80 hrs/week to eat and if we allow that to be the case, then we are allowing these enormous corporations to exploit people for shareholder profit, and I am just fucking done with it.",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think in the long term expanding it to a high level would be beneficial, but in the mean time, we need to balance the right to say no, with the needs of society. That being said, most UBI plans are near poverty level or minimum wage. This is not because we wouldnt like to give more (altho some conservatives certainly wouldn't), but it's because we have to balance our ideals with reality. We need to be pragmatic here. So I think a basic UBI plan of around $12k with $4k for children would be best. Again, it can be expanded in the future if it turns out technology changes our entire outlook on labor, but that's what we can do now. 

Ideally, I'd like universal healthcare too, but at the very least, I'd settle for the current obamacare solution if we need to deal with it.

People would be free to do things that they themselves deem productive or worthy of doing rather than being forced to do things that generate a profit for someone (else usually) in order to survive. This has all kinds of effects that we may not be able to predict, but ultimately I think it would be a positive transformation. There will be work that disappears because people don't find it valuable enough to keep in existence by paying enough to cover the cost of keeping an employee at the cost required over and above UBI. How important is Taco Bell to our society really?

I'm pragmatic though, so I don't see being a radical about it being very productive in the short term.

It needs to be hashed out better. There are a lot of unambitious proposals, but I've yet to see one that would lead to a truly ""free from having to work"" scenario. Although as pointed out in discussion of some of those, being less dependent on a job is still less dependent. I'd like to see something that taxes business based on their savings from being able to offer a similar return for people's work at a lower cost, a per employee tax based on the payment amount with a multiplier to cover the non-working. Combined with a reduced minimum wage, and social security/welfare elimination, it might work out. Of course there are issues with a per employee tax, but again this is coupled with the question of how valuable is a job really to our society if a business won't pay what is required for it to get done?

* Streamline the tax code

No, because like I said, I think the wealth disparity is a generational race issue, I would say that a person in poverty regardless of race in present day are on equal footing with each other outside of fringe circumstances and should get the same level of assistance.

For welfare itself I don’t know what a perfect system looks like, I kind of like Andrew Yang’s proposal of a sort of UBI, because a current issue with the welfare system is the incentive to stay on it, since working hard to get out of poverty is currently just met with ones benefits being stripped away, thus making it more difficult to succeed. Also a UBI is much more palatable to someone who favors individualism such as myself, I don’t like the current system of things like food stamps which force you to spend your benefits on specific things. Perhaps that would help enough? It’s not a perfect system, but I think it would be a step in the right direction from where we are now.

Beyond that I don’t think of myself as educated well enough on the specifics of how much people are provided with on the current system or what the level of aid ought to be.

I know a lot of my colleagues laughed in 2016 when I said Trump would win and can get reelected simply because Americans reelected GWB. The fact is that despite the very long election process, most voters in US seem very ignorant and surprisingly indecisive. And for all its media power, I am surprised that a whole lot of people didn't see Trump as a colourful charlatan and crook politician which someone who grew up in a third world country would have noticed miles away and would have just laughed due to entertainment value and then voted someone else.

Basically a lot of Americans fall for the political bluster on both sides and as a population aren't too keen to open their minds for a long time till they have hurt themselves by trying all the ways others will say not to attempt.
Also you shouldn't be so down, lots of conservative states passed marijuana ballot initiatives. Florida passed 15$ mininum wage. Criminal reform and expanded medicare are also very popular in almost all sections of population. So basically it seems that Americans are liking centre left ideas but not the centre left party.
Trump it seems actually gained more minority votes than last time around and infact is suffering because white men turned away from him, so its definitely not racism. And please correct me if I am wrong but I remember Obama winning Indiana and some right leaning states first time around.

I think what this shows is that yes there are racist and bigots in US but a lot of Americans actually don't look at identity politics but are more interested in economic policies of candidates. Actually make an effort to listen to them and build a conversation. It's something as a leftist myself I hate about fellow leftist who think their ideas and views are good and its the voters who are ignorant. Don't do that, treat them with respect and listen to them. Don't be so impatient and ideologically stiff. If you can get them to agree to maybe 20-30% of your idea then go for it.

Just as Ford found out when he instituted the 40 hour work week. The thing is 40 hours is being shown to not be the most efficient in terms of cost/productivity anymore, but businesses are way behind the times in terms of understanding this because is so culturally opposite to the standard.

Okay, I figured it was something like that.  Once you get more experience in the real world and see how complicated everything is, you'll understand why your utopian ideals of a perfect democracy free of corruption won't actually work.  You'll mellow out a bit and probably end up like me: understanding that capitalist systems distribute power in a more efficient way, but still wanting socialist systems in certain market segments where consumers don't have free choice (e.g. healthcare).

Your post is way too long for me to respond to everything, so I'll just do a quick flyover, and if you have specific issues you want to delve into, then just pick a few to focus on.

And FWIW, I've never been to Israel, but I am disgusted by their treatment of the Palestinians.

1. Capitalism is not based on infinite growth.  Investors currently expect constant growth in the stock market because at this moment in history we are experiencing an unprecedented rate of technological innovation, leading to vastly increased productivity, so it is reasonable to expect companies to grow rapidly right now.
2. Capitalism is not to blame for global warming.  Communist countries would burn coal just the same as capitalist ones.  You yourself said that in your ideal communist country, the people would vote to decide what the country should do.  Those people would like the creature comforts provided by cheap energy just as much as we do, and would vote accordingly.
3. Capitalism can address global warming by implementing a carbon tax with the funds raised being returned to the people as a UBI.  The poor who have a smaller CO2 footprint would get extra money, the rich who have a large CO2 footprint would pay heavy taxes, and companies would have a financial incentive to minimize emissions.
4. There is not ""enough to go around"" to sate everyone's greed.  You understand the threat of global warming, so clearly you must understand that we can't give a private jet and a mansion to everyone who wants one.
5. If you're so sure people are starving to death in America, tell me how many have died that way in the past year?  As far as I'm aware, we don't have statistics on it, because it doesn't happen, unless you count things like ""person stranded in the wilderness.""  Our most common nutrition problem is obesity.
6. The famines in communist countries were not caused by blockades or ""subsidies"" (I assume you mean sanctions?).  They were caused by either mismanagement (e.g. the Chinese famine after Mao ordered the army to kill the sparrows thinking they were a pest, and not realizing they were essential to the ecosystem), or willfully used by the corrupt central government to punish some group they didn't like (e.g. the Holodomor).  There are more examples too, like in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, Ethiopia under the Derg, and Venezuela under Maduro.
7. You can try to claim that Mao and Stalin and all the others weren't communists, but that's a No True Scotsman fallacy.  They existed.  How are you going to prevent people like that from existing in your hypothetical communist utopia?  You say you're going to get rid of the greed in people.  How?
8. American chattel slavery predates capitalism, and later it was the capitalist north that was pushing to abolish it.  You acknowledge atrocities committed under communist states, but again you claim that they're No True Communist, or worse, blame them on foreign blockades.  As if America sent the takes into Tiananmen Square.  How are you going to prevent atrocities in your communist utopia?
9. ""Why can't we acknowledge the past of Capitalism and move forward from there?""  You dismissed this ahead of time, yet you don't give a good explanation of why we can dismiss the past crimes of Communism.  There are capitalist ways of dealing with climate change, which I discussed in #3.
10. Politicians will still have money and power in your ideal system.  They'll actually have even more, since they'll directly control the economy.  And like you said, money and power corrupt.  In theory they'll be using that power to implement the will of the people, but in practice they'll enrich themselves.","Taxonomy: 
- Economic systems",gfskupl,"ok before all that, not a minor but very close, do not lack critical thinking skills but I'd say you do based on the ""Capitalism is wildly successful"" comment, because i dont know if you live under a rock, but we have an economic crash every 10 years or so for a while bud. Capitalism is a system based in infinite growth in a world with, as you say, finite resources. Its an incredibly unstable and volatile system that only had stability due to the plundering and imperialism of places made colonies. With no more new land to plunder and r*pe and steal from, the system you so love is on its death bed, rightfully so.  Also watch the video series I linked if you Actually care to engage in good faith. btw, what do you think capitalism can do for climate change? Because it effectively created that shit in the 300 or so years its been the leading system, so do you think it can solve it? if so, how? the endless contradictions of capitalism and anti communism based solely on all the propaganda you as a person living in the US have internalized is immense. (most things we as Americans are told about communism is propaganda fyi.) Also, are you a liberal, you seem very liberal-ly but faith to capitalism that borders (too nice of a word, it literally is) denial can also mean you are a republican, MAGA much?                                              

Ok onto the rest of your comment.

&gt;Okay, great. Can we both agree that greed is caused by scarcity rather than by capitalism? If so, communism cannot solve it. Resources will still be finite no matter your economic system, which means that there will be people who want things that the system doesn't provide, which means that they will seek out ways to bend the system towards their personal benefit to get those things.

no, we cant agree because im saying that when you meet greed fostered by scarcity with no need to be greedy, ie having enough food for you and your family, (having enough *insert thing* for you and your family whatever it may be), the greed, though it will need to be healed through therapy (lol, capitalism is eeeeevil) it will definitely be remedied because what would you need to be greedy for?? and if you still are greedy oh well? your community can help straighten you up, show you that there is no need, communal healing is the way forward!
also i want you to realize that there IS enough to go around, and your believing that this isnt true is a capitalist lie that does you and anyone around you no good. the only reason you think there isnt enough to go around is because under Capitalism, there isnt enough to go around, because its being hoarded or thrown out because it wont make capitalists a profit.

&gt;We do meet those needs.

This whole paragraph made me laugh because why would you say something so wrong? No one starves in America??? prove it because im legit in shock that someone would say this, prove me wrong I would love for this to be true but im 99.99999999% sure its not, that .1% exists solely because the confidence with which you said that is so funny. But even if that were true, sure! everyone gets to eat. but what about healthcare, what about housing, what about fucking water. what about those needs??? 
And no, I have seen many workers at restaurants as well as grocery stores talk about being forced to throw out foods that were nowhere near expiration (while the homeless and the poor die of starvation, but you say that doesn't happen so i guess it doesn't).

&gt;Meanwhile in communist countries, starvation was common place. Grocery store shelves were frequently empty, so there was nothing for them to throw away. I guess that cuts down on waste, but that doesn't make it a good thing.

The thing about critiques of socialist countries that talk about starvation is that they always, without fail, completely leave out whatever blockades and subsidies or whatever are placed upon said socialist countries and thus also ignore how the rest of the world is ALWAYS jumping at every chance to sabotage said country, thus these countries live constantly with 2984547 other countries having knives to their throats, and how difficult navigating that is. And then you have to take into account how prevalent anti communist propaganda is inside said countries and how that effects the way policies are made and how they follow through. Again, look at the video series i linked on Cuba at the end of my last comment for more about this specific part, if you actually care to.

&gt;But lots of rich people in capitalist countries do give away their money and devote their lives to philanthropy. And there are people in communist countries who live in luxury while people suffer. So again, your issue isn't capitalism versus communism. You're rightfully angry that greedy people exist, but you're wrongly blaming their existence on capitalism.

Those people that live in luxury while others struggle are NOT, i repeat are NOT communists [lmao](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstarecat.com%2Fright-wing-memes-vs-capitalism-communism-in-theory-vs-in-reality%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw3M5aYQuWBzbXVHdt2A8dpf&amp;ust=1608004307827000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCPCN9v7IzO0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)
Originally I found this image and on the left it said ""communist leaders"" and on the slums it said ""ppl under communism"" but i cant find that version anymore. so pretend it says that bc it pertains to what you said, in that what you described is quite literally capitalism aswell, and not some abstraction of capitalism like is the case for those leaders (who honestly I dont know who you may be talking about, any examples? not denying it, some ""communist"" leaders are pricks but again that is not representative of all of communism,it is not an evil ideology as those on the center and right like to claim).
 but sigh. No, I AM blaming capitalism bud. Actual communism seeks to get rid of the need for greediness in people while capitalism breeds them, I know where my anger is being directed towards.

&gt;Whoops, looks like your back to accusing capitalism of all of history's ills, despite admitting in your first paragraph that those things predate capitalism by a lot.

In the first paragraph i talked about greediness not the other things, but they do predate capitalism, but capitalism actively thrives off those inequalities and does NOTHING substantial to get rid of them. That is because again, capitalism is inherently exploitative so of course it will take advantage of already existing inequalities to continue exploiting on many different basis' like race, gender, etc. because it doesnt see those things as bad. 
Specifically that of its relation to Black people in America. You cannot, You CANNOT, if you claim to be an ally of Black people, when in the context of American history and world history as a whole, separate capitalism from white supremacy, because they are systems that play off of each other. Speaking of white supremacy, you're Jewish, the fight against white supremacy should be your own as well!!! Am i wrong? Dont claim to be a Jewish history expert but white supremacy and colonialism are your enemies as much as they are to me and the rest of any oppressed groups. Communism is the fight against all those things. 
Now that we are here I might as well ask, are you a Zionist? What are your feelings towards Israel and Palestine?

&gt;And where is your concern for the Ukrainians, or the Chechens, or the Tibetans, or any other of the minority groups to be face genocide by communist countries? You racist!

My concern for them is the same as any other, I never claimed to be a USSR did nothing wrong type person, no real communist is that type of person.
I am a communist in that I acknowledge the wrong doings of those leaders of the past and work towards a future where Actual Communism is fulfilled, led by Black and Indigenous Trans Revolutionaries who have been at the end of the mercy of Capitalism from its inception. Who know what genocide is and feels like, and who will actively work against the those things. Through the liberation of them there is liberation for us all. But again, the context under which those things you mentioned happened must not be ignored, not that I claim to know but under every anti communist propaganda there is a clear reason things happened the way they did that the pro capitalism bunch tend to overlook, a core problem caused by a Blockade, or foreign intervention, or whatever it may be. Ignoring that context is why anti communism is so widespread, it is the stoking of incredibly Reactionary Flames that when you take the time to calm and look past, reveals very clear problems that a lot of the time has nothing to do with the communism/socialism directly. This is to say that a lot of peoples problems with the mode of production, and more so just reactionary bs. (I am sure as hell not denying genocides though so dont pull that)
We 100% wont see the end of these tragedies under Capitalism though, thats for sure. 
(I feel its important to point out that the acknowledgement of past wrong doings part doesn't work for Capitalism, only saying this so you wont go on and say ""Why cant we acknowledge the past of Capitalism and move forward from there?"" That's because we know what Capitalism is, we know the extent to which it can be stretched, we know that it can not be reformed to meaningfully help anybody, we know that it is a evil, climate disaster accelerating monster so it is a system that must die, i mean at least the Communists know this.)",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

&gt; This is because the UBI, being universal and basic, provides benefits that are unrelated to the actual hours of work an individual provides. You might argue that is not only a strength, but the whole point of an UBI. 

Not only am I going to argue about it being the point of the UBI, I'm going to ask you whether you're against people renting property or receiving interest on money they keep in a bank. Income unrelated to the actual hours of work a person provides is inherent to our economic system, you know, with the whole Matthew effect, money-making-money-phenomenon. For me, at least in this regard, the UBI is nothing new under the Sun. 

&gt; A non-labor related cash grant, such as an UBI, would almost certainly reduce the amount of labor an individual is willing to provide [...] What you would get in this scenario for any individual active in the labor market would be solely an income effect 

Yes, and I'm OK with that for two reasons. 

One, I don't think the decrease in the amount of labor a person is willing to provide will be that great. We're talking about 550 Euro monthly, in Finland. This will cover groceries and utilities, so the big question is: will people be willing to settle for such a life? What about social life? Travel? Life ambitions? Learning? Just having an impact on the world around you in general? I'd argue that with the safety net UBI provides, people will be freer to pursue such things. And the belief that they wouldn't is, well, pretty valid, I guess, but not very capitalistic. Why would you want private ownership of capital if you believe people will be content with life and just stop working if their bare necessities are covered? The whole system is based around the human desire to strive for more. Freeing people of the worry that they might be homeless and hungry will encourage most of them to pursue career paths that require many years of education and/or are lousily paid. Like science, teaching, creative professions, etc. 

Two, a small decrease in the amount of labor an individual is willing to provide is justified. With the middle class disappearing in most developed countries, prices of real estate rising disproportionately to income, etc., I'd argue income distribution, and not productivity, is the real problem. Again, if anything, having to accept long hours, low-income jobs that exist solely because human labor is cheaper than automation, just so you can pay the bills, is what hampers education and productivity. Nothing a UBI and progressive taxation can't fix. ",Labor wages and work conditions,ddowqm9,"Eh, their statement does hold some merit though. 

A non-labor related cash grant, such as an UBI, would almost certainly reduce the amount of labor an individual is willing to provide (unless the Finnish mentality somehow differs substantially from other humans). This is because the UBI, being universal and basic, provides benefits that are unrelated to the actual hours of work an individual provides. You might argue that is not only a strength, but the whole point of an UBI. But I'm skeptical to that notion. What you would get in this scenario for any individual active in the labor market would be solely an income effect (ie individuals reducing their supplied labor in favor of leisure because they receive a larger endowment) without a substitution effect (because wage rates haven't changed the opportunity cost of hours of leisure in terms of labor hasn't changed). I have my doubts if providing people with non-differentiated cash grants *in return for* lower labor force participation is the way for governments to go; at least in the near future.

I'm not arguing that people shouldn't be aided to meet their basic needs (and then some). But an UBI, to me, seems like a rather clumsy system to achieve something for which we have far more efficient tools available. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

&gt; While it may have been theoretically possible to acquire property in a just manner soon after humans evolved, none was. Every square inch of inhabited land on earth can trace its title back to someone who acquired the land by force. All land titles on Earth are soaked in blood. And not just land titles. Thanks to past government spending, targeted tax breaks, intellectual property, corporate charters, slavery, and meddling regulations, no property or wealth can be said to have been justly acquired. If we assume that those who have the least are greatest net victims, a basic income would provide the best possible rectification with the least government control, producing the least unjust system of property distribution possible in the real world.

**My own thoughts:**

The 'kindness' would be from making the choice to live in a country that actually does deliver on the promise of equal opportunity.

Even if all you cared about was money, basic income will save capitalism and be a boon to the economy. It will create a net benefit that will reach everyone.

People want luxury which is why some people work more than 60 hours per week when 40 hours would be enough.

&gt;Granting every American citizen over 21-years old a universal basic income of $13,000 a year — financed by eliminating all transfer programs (including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing subsidies, household welfare payments, and farm and corporate subsidies) — would be a better policy than the status quo.

557,A Land Value Tax is the best way to fund a UBI.,"Taxes, specifically Land Value Tax.",fj341yw,"The reason why a VAT can work is because it is able to draw on something which is inescapable: business transactions. Everyone has to do it if they want to make money. However, it is not the only way. When funding any large program, you have to use a revenue producing method which is both reliable and hard to dodge. VAT on a national scale is hard to dodge, but it’s reliability depends on the health of the economy. UBI would make the economy healthier, but at any time, a large enough event could cause it to suddenly start reducing its generation. Part of the problem with Yang’s plan was that it relied very heavily on the VAT as revenue generation. It isn’t bad, but it also takes a risk. 

This is where other methods come in. Charles Clark has suggested a UBI funded through a flat tax. Based on the numbers from 2002, he concluded that a UBI of around $9,000 per adult and about half that for children could be funded in addition to paying for the rest of the entire federal budget by implementing a flat tax of about 35%. For obvious reasons, this is not ideal, but it is an example of a means to fund it. It is hard to dodge, but because of recessions causing job loss, it isn’t reliable either. Another would be a land value tax. An LVT of about 5% would be enough to provide about $2 trillion. This is where it becomes much more reliable. Land values rarely go down, as real estate tends to trend upward in its value over time. Additionally, it has the advantage of being immovable. You can’t just pick up your piece of land and move it to Canada. Then, there is the obvious wealth tax, which has been hit to death in this sub enough to not need to go into details. 

UBI can be very easily funded without a VAT. However, a VAT allows UBI to be partially paid for by its use. The best method would honestly be a combination of various taxes. Really, I would prefer Yang to have added a LVT of around 2.5% to generate $1 trillion, then allow full overlap with welfare and he could even be less reliant on the VAT since that could pull in nearly half as much as predicted and the program would still be funded.

That can happen in a multitude of ways and if the owner class wants to keep from being put against  the wall they can either start paying people better wages (possibly forced to by a more unionized work force or through legislation), implement a UBI (which allows them to maintain the ownership of capital), or go full fascist and empty state violence to quell the uprising.

You're absolutely correct that the corporations will continue to capture the value created by the working class to pay the owners, this is capitalism's intent. This is why the working class, who greatly outnumber the corporate owner class, must join together, unionize, block vote for proworker candidates, and march in the streets demanding better pay. 

What you are suggesting is that we just roll over and accept that getting fucked over by the capitalist owner class because we don't have any alternative.... We do have alternatives, but they all require direct action and an increased class consciousness.","- Economic systems

575,"**Socialists working from within to push Democratic Party further left**

Democratic candidates around the country now seek their blessing. Americans are joining their ranks by the thousands, rapidly expanding the group's membership rolls in just a few years.

And a sharply leftist political agenda that once produced eye rolls – on everything from their opposition to capitalism to their questioning the very existence of prisons – has become a serious topic of discussion on social media, and in mainstream political debate.

In short, it’s going according to a plan by the Democratic Socialists of America, a group that’s dedicated to pushing an anti-capitalist, socialist platform by infiltrating and working within the Democratic Party, and pushing it further and further to the left.

“Progressive and socialist candidates who openly reject the neoliberal mainstream Democratic agenda may choose for pragmatic reasons to use the Democratic Party ballot line in partisan races,” wrote Joseph M. Schwartz, vice chairman of the DSA, in the socialist Jacobin Magazine last August. “But whatever ballot line the movement chooses to use, we must always be working to increase the independent power of labor and the left.”

The Democratic Socialists playbook, detailed on its website, calls for a methodical march to becoming a truly national force – where they can run candidates and push ideas under a Socialist Party banner – by first working from within the Democratic establishment. That strategy paid off big with the recent congressional primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old DSA member who much of the media has ordained the new face of the Democratic Party. 

Ocasio-Cortez plans to stump for other Democratic primary candidates in the coming days, in Kansas and Michigan. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a self-described Democratic socialist, reportedly will join for one of the stops. 

The DSA, which is not a formal political party but bills itself as the largest socialist organization in the U.S., is working its way into the Democratic Party in part because of its failure to advance its own brand with a voting public reflexively suspicious of hard-left socialist policies. So it set a goal of working with groups devoted to a wide range of issues like health care, college debt, immigration, and racism to see socialism – and Democratic Socialist political candidates – as the vehicle for policy changes.

“If we don’t relate politically to social forces bigger than our own, DSA could devolve into merely a large socialist sect or subculture,” wrote Schwartz and his co-author, Bhaskar Sunkara, founder of Jacobin Magazine.

The organization also has recognized it needs to broaden the diversity of its own membership, which it concedes is predominately white, male and upper-income.

“We will focus on overcoming this historic bias of our organization toward white (particularly male) activists. We will do this by building deeper ties with organizations representing poor and working-class women and people of color …  We must do so with humility and take our lead from the organizations that organize and are led by poor and working-class people in those communities.”

Political experts say the soul searching is somewhat surprising.

“They seem very pragmatic, which to me doesn’t seem very Socialist,” said Daniel Pout, an instructor at Arizona State University’s School of Politics and Global Studies. “They have to almost be non-socialist in order to be popular.”

The DSA’s effort to push their causes through the Democratic political machine has met with success. Ocasio-Cortez has grabbed the headlines and broad media attention, but the DSA claims its candidates have won 22 of some 30 elections they took part in.

Whatever the numbers, it’s become trendy for Democratic Party candidates to align themselves with the Democratic Socialists. One of the more prominent examples is Cynthia Nixon, the former “Sex and the City” actress who is running against Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the New York Democratic gubernatorial primary.

“It’s nice to see that our policies and what we espouse are resonating with people running for governor,” said Abdullah Younous, co-chair of DSA’s New York City chapter, to Politico. “The landscape is really shifting, and people are noticing it across the state.”

And the Democratic establishment, feeling the pressure to perform well in this year's midterm elections, doesn't seem terribly concerned about the DSA's efforts to push the party even further left. 

""The DNC's mission is to elect Democrats from the school board to the oval office, and we welcome the help of all organizations to achieve that goal,"" said Sabrina Singh, deputy communications director for the Democratic National Committee. The DSA declined to comment for this article. 

That leaves Democratic Socialists in a position to withhold their endorsement if a Democratic candidate isn’t far-left enough, posing a challenge to those who see the group as a vehicle to boost their chances of getting elected.

A flyer at a New York City DSA meeting to discuss whether to endorse Nixon was quoted by Politico as saying: “We don’t just grant endorsements to progressives who beg us for one. We endorse people who can advance the anti-capitalist struggle.”

DSA members say Democratic candidates must be willing to embrace policy positions like universal housing and health care, free public college education, shelter and transportation, the abolition of ICE, of the U.S. Senate, of prisons, and an economy where the worker is the priority. The DSA website also calls for everyone to receive a basic income -- whether or not they work.

The group has said it wants to move away from the image – though not all the tenets –  of Marxist-Leninist principles. It does not want to be seen as a fringe group, so DSA-backed candidates frequently quote names like Martin Luther King, Jr. and Franklin D. Roosevelt, rather than Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin.

Critics say they are determined to hit back at what they depict as a Marxist fox in Democratic sheep’s clothing. A large part of the Democratic Socialists’ growing support comes from younger voters who have no memory of the Cold War, and the more sinister threat and reputation of the Soviet Union and other Socialist states around the world.

“This is the tactic that Communist parties and socialist movements have used all over the world to gain influence in the political world,” said Murray Bessette, academic programs director of the The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit. “We saw that in Venezuela. They didn’t come to power as Communists, but that is what they were.”

Bessette said his group teaches about authoritarian regimes that started out by downplaying or denying socialist or Communist leanings.

“Martin Luther King very explicitly considered viewing the Soviet Union and socialists as allies for civil rights in the U.S.,” Bessette said. “But [ultimately] his great speeches, his call for civil rights, were a call for the American people to live up to the principles of the Declaration of Independence. It was an embrace of democratic values, not a rejection of them.”

Some Republicans across the country see opportunities to pick up critical swing votes if Democrats lurch too far left before November’s congressional elections.

“Democratic Socialism is a false paradise,” said Marc Molinaro, Dutchess County, N.Y., executive and front-runner for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. “What New Yorkers and Americans want is the ability to achieve success. Every American family deserves individual freedom, and the opportunity to achieve real success.”

“I don’t think New Yorkers or Americans want to embrace a party that hands over all aspects of our lives to a government that can barely provide services competently.”

Republicans believe they can also capitalize on issues like the Social Democrats’ call to abolish the ICE agency, which is picking up more support among more mainstream Democrats. Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan last week introduced legislation to abolish ICE, which led House Speaker Paul Ryan to say Democrats “have really jumped the shark on the left.”

Perhaps in response to the hard swing left among many candidates, some Democratic Party leaders asked Socialist candidates to tone down their anti-capitalist, pro-universal public benefits rhetoric. But emboldened Democratic Socialists don’t seem in the mood for compromise.

Democratic Socialist candidate Franklin Bynum, who in March won the Democratic nomination to be a Houston criminal court judge, simply refused Democratic Party leaders’ pressure to make his tone more mainstream. Bynum made clear the Democratic Party machine was useful to him, for now, given the limits of what he could achieve on the margins.

“If I have money, I will give them money because I can’t organize a get-out-the-vote campaign by myself,” he told the New York Times. “But I am focused more on building a movement than I am on helping Democrats get elected. My priority is reaching people who aren’t being spoken to at all.”

Pout, the Arizona professor, thinks socialists might someday have a chance at building enough support to run candidates of their own, under the Socialist Party banner.

""There’s an attack on the center, in both parties, on business-as-usual,” Pout said. “Jeff Flake, in my state, decided not to run again, he sees no way he can fight against this anti-establishment, anti-status-quo” environment.

In the next few decades, we are going to see some of the staples of the economy decimated by automation (transportation, food service and retail). As an aside.. I think we’re closer than most people realize because we’ve been in economic expansion and businesses haven’t been focused on costs, so the next recession will be an interesting barometer of technological capability.

Job automation is a good thing. But it accelerates employment consolidation and wealth concentration. This creates a short term problem of a serious skills gap in the economy. You can’t retrain a million truck drivers to become software engineers. But it also has a long term consequence of there simply being less jobs for humans. Capital is going to continue flow to the most efficient user. The most efficient user will be those that employee the fewest “expensive humans”. It’s kind of an bleak but inevitable optimization of shareholder-centric capitalism.

Doesn’t it make sense to tax the value added by the displacing technology and distribute the capital back to citizens? Everyone gets a piece. Regardless of employment status or willingness to work.

602,"So you think a communist revolution is more likely than countries deciding to enact a livable UBI? I would disagree. 

Also the classes you describe are not as distinct as you seem to think. Rich households tend to work more hours than poor households. Many business owners are not rich and would be personally in debt if their business went under. Businesses fail all the time in developed economies and they don’t lead to people starving to death",Economic systems,ekbueaq,"&gt;For instance, in many modern economies there is a safety net that provides for unemployed citizens and as that expands, hopefully we reach a point where no one is forced into taking a job out of survival.

Capitalism would never result in that expansion though. The ""goal"" of Capitalism is to get people who own capital (money in the form of potential investment) as rich as possible. For that to happen, labour must be cheap. To keep labour as cheap as possible, the system **requires** that a big part of the population stay poor in unemployment. With an improving safety net such as you describe, people wouldn't be desperate enough, and therefore labour wouldn't be cheap enough for Capitalism to reach its last stage, so the capitalist system does whatever possible to prevent those improvements.

&gt;One disagreement I have with this view is there is no accounting for the role the business owner plays in arranging the employees’ work. If the business were never started then the employee could not have performed the work for the same value. Does the organization of the business have no value? 

There *is* accounting. If someone's work is to organize the work assigned to employees, then _it is labour._ Communism doesn't deny that fact. They are also part of the working class, and also should be paid for their labour. What Communism criticizes is the system that allows people who _don't work at all to still reap most of the profits,_ i.e. the current owners of the means of production.

Remember, in Capitalism there are two distinct social classes: The bourgeoisie and the working class. If you need to work to survive, no matter whether you have employees or not, you are working class.

&gt;Or what about the risk of personal loss? The owner has much more to lose if the business goes under, so doesn’t it make sense that he would have more to gain as well?

The biggest risk bourgeoisie take when they start a business is, if everything fails, to lose all their capital, thus lowering their social class, thus making them from then on **part of the working class.** In contrast, not only their workers are already there, the risk a worker takes in the same situation (the business they work on fails) is to lose that job and their homes, starve, and possibly die. Not to mention the risk of getting sick and collect a massive amount of debt for it, if they live somewhere with no public health sevices.

The UBI will be a stimulus like no other, because it places money directly into the hands of consumers in an economy powered 70% by consumer spending. There will be significant economic growth resulting from the UBI. See study below: 
https://rooseveltinstitute.org/starting-conversation-economics-universal-basic-income/

As for how it is funded, it will be funded by the VAT tax, increased government revenue from the economic growth, overlaps with existing welfare programs and other synergies involved with crime rates and societal stability.  Each part is almost equally important as the rest.

And honestly you’re probably the only Democratic candidate I even could see myself voting for.  But my biggest worry is about your Freedom Dividend and how it will be funded.  I just don’t think a VAT is going to raise even close to enough money to fund it.  There is roughly somewhere around 240- 250 million Americans over 18 in this country(estimated).   That would put the total yearly cost of the freedom dividend at somewhere near 3 trillion dollars per year for $12,000 per person.   That’s getting close to the entire federal revenue each year.  You are essentially going to come close to doubling the entire federal budget.  I get that people are going to drop off Medicaid and disability, but that still won’t even come close to filling this massive gap between what is being taken in and what is being paid out.  Realistically how is this going to be done?  Are you going to raise taxes other than VAT?  Could you increase the VAT tax to 20%?  I just don’t see the math here.  What it looks like is going to happen is I’m going to give the government an extra 12,000 dollars a year in taxes of some sort and they are going to give me back 12,000.  Why not just decrease the freedom dividend to something more doable like $500 a month?  It would still be a tough one to come up with the funds still, but at least it wouldn’t kill the middle class.  I am all for a lot of these help the people programs, but the problem they all seem to have like Warren’s Medicare for all is that we say the rich will pay for it when the reality is that the middle class always ends up footing the bulk of the bill.  I know I’m asking a lot of questions and I apologize for that.  

To sum it all up into one question: How will the Freedom Dividend be implemented so it doesn’t turn into another heavy burden for the middle class to carry with almost no real benefit in the end and the only winners being the poor and the super wealthy?  

I really enjoy hearing you speak but I really hope you can address these concerns about the freedom dividend because if done poorly it’s something that could put the entire US economy in jeopardy.

Im not saying that at all.  It's not meant to replace welfare state writ large. Just a few of the different bureaucracies already basiclaly doing the same thing. That doesn't mean an outright decimation, merely a replacement for all those services into a new form.  Welfare state just the same. That doesn't change.

&gt;Conclusion 1 gives the lie to this argument: the rock-bottom UBI we receive will not be a replacement for the welfare state, except for some of the healthy working poor, who are capitalists' ideal proletarians. The old, the young, and the unhealthy will suffer deprivation.

The worst off would benefit from it. I wouldnt be advocating for a UBI if I didn't think it would help those that need it most. eg. The people I work with on the streets everyday.  The old, the young, and the unhealthy would be provided a more dignified existence. 

&gt;And what do we pay for this privilege of a minimal UBI designed by our enemies?

If we are describing this as the equivalent of the new deal, it cant be THAT bad.  Again, would still be better than what currently exists. 

&gt;Global warming is on track to kill around 5 billion people in this century, and will render large parts of the earth humanly uninhabitable.

Agreed. 

&gt;We have 20 to 25 years to make drastic changes in the world's economies before ""on track"" changes to ""guaranteed.""

Maybe. Maybe not. 

&gt;Capitalism is in its death throes, courtesy of neoliberalism having rendered capitalism incapable of reproducing itself as it destroys the nations and workers on which it parasitizes.

Were in the late stages to be sure.  No disagreement from me there. But it doesn't stop me from supporting social democratic welfare policies in the meantime, when and where I can.  You said it yourself.  The bar is so fucking low right now, I think social democracy in the US is like a fucking utopia for them. We arent all THAT different here in Canada, but there are some extreme differences. Christ, the US doesn't even have universal health care yet. :/

&gt;As history shows, when their class is threatened with annihilation, capitalists will make allowances to the proletariat, as we saw in the aftermath of the Gilded Age and again after WWII. 

And even before WWII during the great depression... Keynesian economics, New Deal  and all. 

And they only made allowances when people demanded it. 8hr work day, 5 day work week, miimum wage, etc. etc. 

Im not saying we should let our overlords decide for us.  And i agree that when push comes to shove they will provide a few more crumbs.. (which is all that the new deal did anyways as we know)  but it was still better than it was previously.   

Again, I'm not saying a UBI is the be all end all.  Merely a way to provide a little more dignified existence than what currently exists. 

That's it. 

And you're saying it wont be. It will just be tailored by the oligarchs, so don't bother.  But I find that a bit short sighted when you take into account market factors. Again, **they need consumers.**  They need us to buy their garbage. And they WANT us to have enough money to do that. 

&gt;Neoliberalism has presented another such threat, as capitalism has driven itself into a corner by creating a proletariat that can no longer afford to consume. 

Exactly! Hence, UBI!

&gt;In the past, the response was things like the New Deal and the Great Society. 

:) We're on the same page. 

&gt;Today, it's UBI. As conclusion 1 shows, the UBI will be designed to allow the proletariat to consume again, thereby allowing capitalism to limp on until the next crisis of its own making. 

Yep. That's not in contention.  I mentioned that in my intial comment.   

&gt;We have 20-25 years to create radical change before the apocalypse begins in earnest. A UBI will quite possibly allow capitalism to continue breathing for 20-25 years. By accepting a hostile UBI designed by our enemies, we forfeit humanity's future. This is conclusion 2.

So, you DO advocate accelerationism. That's kinda what I'm getting from this conversation. 

I dunno man.  

&gt;There is no ethical dilemma. If apocalypse wasn't a factor, mitigating suffering for a few million while perpetuating suffering for billions could be argued. But that's not the calculus we're presented with. Mitigating suffering for a few million while actively causing the deaths of most of humanity isn't acceptable. 

You're saying that the apocalypse is a given. 

I dont neccessarily agree with that. 

Yeah. Climate change is happening. But to say that will this is guarenteed to end of the world in exactly 20-25 years is not a given. 

Yes. We should do our best to unplug from the capitalist market system. Yes. Organize community for collective projects.  But that doesn't change the fact that people still need money to live. right. now. 

You're saying just let them starve? That a UBI wont help. I don't agree. People **are**  starving. And a UBI would help with that. 

And It is absolutely an ethical dilemma for someone like me. To call myself a socialist and then say fuck the social is a contradiction of the highest levels. That's all I'm seeing here. Use what you got, eg. a UBI, while still actively working on projects to undermine the social structures that rule over us. That's my thinking on it. 

And if this is a position you disagree with I eill assume you would advocate molotov cocktailng the non profit I work at helping  street entrenched individuals.  It's the same argument. 

&gt;That's what a capitalist would choose. If we're not better than that, what's the point?

We are better than that.  We care about eachother. And that's why a UBI is a good idea, for the interim. 

Educate. Agitate. Organize. 

Yes. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't still take what we can in the meantime. ","Taxonomy: 
- Economic systems",edg4afq,"You are very much misunderstanding my argument.

Capitalism is class warfare. The realities of class and history show that capitalists would prefer us to be dead so that we can't resist them and don't take any share of ""their"" profit, but they need us alive to do work and to buy things. You have acknowledged that fact.

That fact means that capitalists have no incentive to help us beyond keeping us able to work and consume, and they have every incentive to harm us. You have acknowledged that.

Governments are wholly owned by capitalists and work toward their goals, and the proletariat has no control over or say in government. You have acknowledged that.

Now we follow the logic through. Those facts mean that any UBI designed by capitalists - which any UBI will be - will be designed as an absolute minimum, insufficient to support life in any way beyond bare existence and consumption. This is conclusion 1.

A major component of the discussion of UBI, which you yourself have repeated several times, is that it will necessarily involve the end of the welfare state. The right makes this argument because of supposed budgetary reasons, and the left agrees with their argument because the UBI will supposedly replace the welfare state in a way which does not deprive the proletariat. Conclusion 1 gives the lie to this argument: the rock-bottom UBI we receive will not be a replacement for the welfare state, except for some of the healthy working poor, who are capitalists' ideal proletarians.

With regards to 1, I don’t think what they’re doing is really as bad as it is made out to be by many here because early grades aren’t affected (or so they say).

At work, your employer will use UBI as a form of subsidized wages. They will pay the least amount possible just to make sure that they have someone to work for them. Now for people already making low income wages, this could see their fall greatly UNLESS minimum wages are enforced, and Yang has said that he is AGAINST minimum wage which is straight out of extreme right wing economics like Mises or Rothbard. 

Now the worst part of this idea, the lower middle class, which are usually in direct competition with the poor in the housing market, will get a boost in purchasing power. The poor will have their benefits reduced to a lump sum. This means that their purchasing power in relation to the lower income middle class will decrease even more. The gap will widen and the poor will be driven out of the housing market in areas where there is a thriving market. The poor will leave areas like NYC and California and move to cheaper states that have even less to offer and most likely will become unemployed because of the exodus of poor people from rich areas which will then exclude them from being active members of society. 

The cherry on the cake is that anyone under 18 and non-citizens DO NOT QUALIFY for Yangs UBI. Since they don’t qualify they will suffer all the negative affects of that I’ve listed above. So they would pay the tax and get nothing out of it. 

Also, what happens when there is a financial crash and the purchase power of the public drops? That will cause an even bigger strain on government debt which will lead to more anger from the right wing politicians which will then lead to more privatization of government and public services.

**Please join us at the linked thread for the AMA!**

___________

[I am Michael Cholbi](http://michael.cholbi.com/), Professor of Philosophy at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. I work and publish in a number of area of ethics, including ethical theory, moral psychology, practical ethics, and the history of moral philosophy. Much (though not all) of my work has a Kantian flavor – but do note I’m willing to take Kant and Kantians to task when need be! (For a good overview of my work on Kant’s ethics, check out my book *Understanding Kant’s Ethics*).

Here are some more specifics about my research:

* I’m perhaps best known for my work on philosophy of death and dying, including my work on [suicide](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suicide/) and grief. With respect to suicide, my views are complicated: I argue that most acts of suicide violate our Kantian duty to preserve our rational agency, but precisely because this is a self-regarding duty or duty to self, then at a social level, individuals have an autonomy-based right to shorten their lives, consistent with their moral obligations to others; that medically assisted dying is not contrary to the moral norms of medicine and that the medical profession should not monopolize access to desirable ways of shortening our lives; that, all other things being equal, mental health problems provide equally strong justifications for suicide as do ‘physical’ ailments, etc.; and that non-invasive public health measures to prevent suicide are typically defensible. 

* Grief is an understudied phenomenon among philosophers. Much of my work here is concerned with understanding how grief can makes our lives better — why we wouldn’t find it desirable to be unable to grieve, [like Meursault in Camus’ *The Stranger*](http://www.fourbythreemagazine.com/issue/death/the-stranger-the-saint-and-griefs-goodness) — despite the fact that it involves pain or mental distress. [In the book I’m writing](https://www.academia.edu/31062180/No_Delight_But_in_Tears_A_Philosophical_Examination_of_Grief_introduction_), I propose that grief represents an especially fruitful opportunity to know ourselves and understand our own commitments and values more deeply. 

* In other areas of social ethics, I write on paternalism, defending what I call the ['rational will' conception](https://philpapers.org/rec/CHOPAO) of paternalism, [wherein paternalism is wrong because it intercedes in our powers of rational agency in various ways](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/theforum/identity-threat/); on race and criminal justice, where I argue ([in a forthcoming paper in *Ethics*](https://philpapers.org/archive/CHOBLM.pdf)) that racial bias in the administration of the death penalty in the U.S. merits its de facto abolition; and on the philosophy of work and labor, a new area of research where I’m exploring universal basic income and notions of meaningful work.

As you can tell, my work is very diverse, both topically and methodologically. I try to integrate empirical work from economics, legal studies, and psychiatry into my research where appropriate. 

I look forward to discussing any and all of my work with the reddit audience!

657,"M4A is great, and it should ideally complement UBI, but in my more recent projections, I'm not entirely sure we can fund both adequately. 

Like, UBI at this point, for a GOOD UBI, is almost $4 trillion. M4A would cost around $2 trillion, on top of existing medicare/medicaid spending. 

I'm not ENTIRELY sure we can fund both. Like I have a few proposals where I've tried before, but it's possible we might have to sacrifice one to adequately fund the other.

If you had to choose between a ~$10000 UBI and full on medicare for all, or a ~$14000 UBI and a public option (such as, say, [medicare extra for all](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/medicare-extra/)), which would you choose? Alternatively if you had to choose between a NIT and M4A vs UBI and a public option, which would you choose? NIT would cost less on paper, closer to $1 trillion, but it would come with more bureaucracy, would likely be more regressive because the tax burden would be replaced by some sort of clawback mechanism, and could be undermined and turned into welfare far more quickly. But yeah.

I guess even the public option via my preferred medicare extra for all plan if we go thay way vs medicare for all is a matter of whether the costs are public or private too. You're paying either way. It's just whether that comes in the form of a tax or crap like deductibles and copays. 

Idk. Like, we definitely need a more public healthcare system. The real answer is how much. IDEALLY I am right there with UBI, but again, considering my look into taxation, stuff like laffer curves, how it might influence things like work incentives, it's possible that we might need to make a sacrifice somewhere. Would you rather have a full UBI and a public option push comes to shove? Or a partial UBI or an NIT with M4A?

It really is hard to say, isnt it? I'd lean toward downgrading my M4A plan to a robust public option, but I do acknowledge theres a ton of downsides to that.

And if people are wondering my logic here, see these articles:

My 2022 UBI plan: https://outofplatoscave2012.blogspot.com/2022/03/funding-universal-basic-income-march.html

A discussion from last year about what the maximum UBI under various taxation and spending levels, also includes discussion of medicare for all and you'll see I ended up having to revert from a $13,200 UBI at the time to a $9000 one.

https://outofplatoscave2012.blogspot.com/2021/04/where-is-laffer-curve-really-and-what.html

Continuing my train of thought and trying to find some sort of synthesis between the Sanders and Yang agendas in a way that allowed us to fund UBI and M4A at the same time:

\&gt;  It would do nothing to curtail hunger, rising rents, white supremacy, or any of the other problems that we are failing to solve.

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree tremendously. Getting $1000 a month without strings attached would absolutely reduce all those criteria: hunger, rent, racial tensions. When they did tests in rural mexican villages if a UBI would cause inflation in food prices, it didn't. In terms of rent, it allows the rental of a modest property outside city limits or the option to group together inside a city with higher rent. In terms of white supremacy, a radicalization process that occurs to poor whites without options, having financial security would mitigate a lot of the anger and hopelessness felt.

&amp;#x200B;

A UBI doesn't ""solve"" these problems, but to say it would do ""nothing"" is absolutely false.

&amp;#x200B;

At the very least, Yang's UBI proposal aims to redistribute wealth from tech monopolization. Much more needs to be done but there's literally no other candidate who's proposing meaningful solutions.

UBI does not seriously attempt to address the issues that are caused by income inequality and capitalism. It would do nothing to curtail hunger, rising rents, white supremacy, or any of the other problems that we are failing to solve.

Also most people are against raising taxes anyways. I don't think ~1/5 of our GDP (based on 2013 figures of 16.7 Trillion) should go towards just handing out free money.

667,"&gt;Du har ingen garanti for at ein jobb bidrar til at «verda går framover» berre fordi han er betalt, og det ein gjer på fritida kan like gjerne bidra til dette, avhengig av kva ein bruker fritida til.

Som jeg skrev kan jeg jo forstå at det er vanskelig å skjønne hva jeg mener hvis man tror på Graeber og denne ville ideen om at jobb er dårlig.

Du har ingen *garanti* for at en jobb bidrar til at verden går fremover, men du har heller ingen *garanti* for at du overlever morgendagen. Hvis du er avhengig av *garantier* blir det litt rart å planlegge å leve 15 år som en tibetansk munk, sånn i tilfelle du holder ut lenge nok til å kunne nyte en slags pensjonisttilværelse etterpå.

Det rasjonelle er å se på sannsynlighet. Hvis du får betalt for å utføre en oppgave er det *overveiende sannsynlig* at den oppgaven har en verdi for noen, og dermed bidrar til at samfunnet går fremover. Fantasien om *bullshit jobs* som ikke betyr noe er nettop det, en fantasi. De som tror det ikke spiller noen rolle om de dukker opp på jobb eller ikke forstår enkelt og greit ikke hva deres rolle går ut på.

&gt;Slik er det neppe - ein person som har 1 million i årsløn arbeider sjeldan dobbelt så lenge som ein som har 500 000 i årsløn, og legg neppe ned dobbelt så mykje innsats. Kan dei vera dobbelt så effektive viss det er snakk om same type jobb? Kanskje, men det er det heller ingen garanti for, og treng ikkje å ha noko med kor solid innsats ein legg i arbeidet.

Innsats er for deltagermedaljer. Resultater er det som betyr noe.

For å forstå grunnleggende økonomi hjelper det *alltid* å se for seg en grunntilstand uten NAV, matbutikker, elektrisitet og rennende vann.

Du kan dyrke jord. Kalle kan snekre hus. Hver for dere er livet surt. Du fryser, for du har ikke noe sted å bo, og Kalle er sulten i huset sitt, for han kan ikke produsere mat. Sammen er dere et marked. Du dyrker mat for Kalle, og Kalle bygger og vedlikeholder hus til deg. Senere møter dere Klaus som kan lage dekketøy, og Katrine som kan lage klær. Igjen, hver for dere er livet surt, men etter hvert som flere spesialiteter introduseres i økonomien deres blir livet bedre. Siden det er vanskelig å bytte hus mot tallerkener utvikler dere en valuta, og kan begynne å betale hverandre en type penger for jobben dere gjør.

Etter hvert blir dere kjent med Karsten, som er flink til å tegne. Nå har dere en helt ny kategori gode i økonomien deres, nemlig kulturprodukter. Karsten mener han burde få like mye betalt per år som deg og Kalle. Er det rettferdig? Hvis du slutter å jobbe kommer alle til å sulte ihjel. Hvis Kalle slutter å jobbe kommer alle til å fryse.

Vi spoler frem noen år. Vi har en kompleks, hyperspesialisert økonomi. Et resultat av dette er at dere har avansert elektronikk, medisin og infrastruktur. Samtidig har vi problemer. Det er ikke lenger lett å se at det er Kalle som gir oss et sted å bo, og Karsten som lager tegninger til oss.

I stedet har vi navnløs kontorrotte 241, som ikke er i stand til (som ikke er rart, i en kompleks økonomi) å se sammenhengen med at han kvalitetssikrer skjema AGDFS2345987 dag etter dag, og at vannforsyningen fortsetter å være stabil uten at noen kan lure til seg noen millioner på fellesskapets bekostning. Noen av deltagerne i økonomien har rett og slett så spesialiserte funksjoner at de ikke selv forstår helt hva det er de driver med, og begynner å stille spørsmål ved om de i det hele tatt gjør noe verdifullt. Dette er UBI-gjengen.

Samtidig har du en annen stor gruppe deltagere i økonomien som ikke har tilegnet seg kompetanse til å gjøre noe hyperspesialisert. De tømmer søppel, de vasker sengetøy, og de løfter eldre opp og ned av doskåla. Det er klart at de gjør en viktig jobb, og de gjør helt sikkert en stor innsats. Større enn kontorrotte 241. Men kontorrotte 241 har tilegnet seg spesielle ferdigheter, og er ikke lett å erstatte, slik som deg og Kalle i den enkle økonomien. Er det rettferdig å gi disse ufaglærte mer lønn enn den umotiverte kontorrotta? Hvis den ufaglærte kontorrotta slutter å jobbe vil vannforsyningen til hele samfunnet bryte sammen, og fellesskapets begrensede midler vil gå i lomma på en korrupt type. Hvis en ufaglært, uansett kategori, slutter å jobbe, kan hvem som helst andre overta jobben. Fordi den er ufaglært.

Idéen om at det er egoistisk å jobba for å pensjonera seg tidleg gir mest meining om det var slik at alle fekk like mykje betalt for den tida eller innsatsen ein la ned for arbeidet, slik at det var meir som ein felles dugnad for samfunnet.

687,"&gt;I would argue that specific conditions are needed for democracy to bloom:

Well, the trouble is that these conditions aren't exactly clear. We know that a most successful Western democracies have common traits, but predicting what makes successful lasting democracies in other countries is notoriously difficult. 

However, some things we do know about the rise of democracy in Europe is that it wasn't really down to a 'revolution of the people'. That was tried, during the French Revolution, and while pro-democracy sentiments were certainly stirred up by it, the revolution itself was not very succesful. The successful turns to democracy were generally not lead by the common people, but wealthy businessmen who wanted to take power away from the nobility. You can clearly see this in early democracies: many explicitly only let wealthy land-owning men vote. Of course, this would change later, with a major driving force being the rhetoric and ideals these wealthy landowners claimed to espouse. If you start a revolution by shouting about equality for the common people (as in, non-nobility), it's hard to then defend the notion that only the wealthy should get a vote.

My point is: democracy is very complicated. It cannot be simply boiled down to a short list of causes, nor can we assume that the things that allow a democracy to rise are also necessary for its continuation.

&gt; It isn't clear that a UBI would solve the problems presented by humans becoming useless

But humans won't become useless. They may stop being the driving force of economic production (though, by definition, they will remain the driving force of economic consumption), but that isn't all that people are. Humans have social, moral, aesthetic, and so many other aspects other than economics.

&gt; Let's say we automate much of the economy and redistribute wealth effectively through a UBI

So let's go with your own example. The military is entirely replaced by drones which are produced automatically, and virtually all other goods are produced by automation too. Citizens receive a basic income which allows them to afford their needs and reasonable wants. In such a society, the only reason that money is still a thing at all is the last vestige of scarcity: the machines can't produce enough for everyone to lead a billionaire lifestyle, but they can produce enough for everyone to live comfortably.

In such a situation, what motivation does the government have to oppress its citizens and ruin their lives? Even if there was an aristocracy, what gain would it bring them? In the past, aristocracies were exploitative because the nobles lived in luxury, supported by the work of the peasants. But in your hypothetical society, all the work is automated. Making the peasants work doesn't add anything. The ruler would have to be a cartoon villain, wanting people to die just to watch them die, to have any motivation for oppression. And violent revolution would quickly occur against such a ruler.

With regards to outside military pressures: what's the point if society is automated to this degree? In your hypothetical, drone factories are so advanced that soldiers are no longer needed. That indicates that the destructive force of all armies far exceeds what is necessary to destroy the other nation. Once you have enough nukes to render the entire planet unliveable several times over, why build more nukes? A bigger arsenal is no longer a bigger threat once you get to the point of complete destruction.","- Automation and jobs
- Economic systems",eb7iue0,"&gt; So if we accept that motivations like keeping your citizens happy do exist for a state (and not just because happy citizens produce more and therefore provide taxes to use for military forces), we needn't be bothered by the fact that UBI is not the perfect investment for the government.*



**Democracy is not guaranteed**
There was a time before democracy. And there was a democracy before the time before democracy. A few hundred years ago, the west was entirely aristocracy. Rights weren't guaranteed and social justice was accidental at best. 

It's not like kings decided that ruling was wrong. They lost power as individuals seized it. Money moved to the cities. Individuals and corporations became more powerful than Aristocrats. Communication got cheaper and the people learned to read. I would argue that specific conditions are needed for democracy to bloom:

- populace with education/literacy
- Middle class wealth
- National identity
- A volunteer army (or at least the will of the people)
- A citizenry with inherent economic value

I'm sure there are others. 

But it's not like technological progress guaranteees democracy either. Before kings, there were the Greek and Roman republics. 
When socio-economic conditions changed democracy failed to thrive and aristocracy returned.

### The Cost of Free(dom)


The fundamental problem of automation is that as it expands, it makes humans useless to each other. Democracy works because it allows us to work together to achieve a common goal. Happiness, justice, and society are all side effects. A government's first responsibility is self preservation - otherwise a competing society will destroy it and take its resources. 

**It isn't clear that a UBI would solve the problems presented by humans becoming useless**

Let's say we automate much of the economy and redistribute wealth effectively through a UBI. 

The government doesn’t need willing soldiers, or tax payers. All those conditions on the list above become an added expense to the society. The more stable form of governance would be aristocracy again. 

I think this will have real impact on policy and behavior over time in a way that does not bode well for the value of human life. Democracy didn't come about because kings wanted to give up power. **As humanity industrialized, the value of individuals went up and their political capital followed.**

If we structure our society to reduce the fundamental value of a citizen, our rights and the power of the vote will follow. Our democracy is currently showing itself to be susceptible to antidemocratic pressure. ",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

704,"Famine and absolute poverty were once accepted as inevitable for the majority of the population. Billions of humans have wasted their lives in tedious, physically demanding agricultural occupations, then promptly died at 30. No doubt they also told their children ""that's just life"".

Scarcity can be mitigated by productivity increases. However, we need to make political choices about both how to drive those productivity increases and how best to capture those gains to improve human lives.

That's what UBI is about. It's a recognition that most people don't make major supply side contributions to GDP, and never will so long as they're forced to accept low-value labour for survival. Our contribution to the system is primarily as agents of demand - consumers, not workers.

If we can, we should indeed free people from flipping burgers and shitty retail jobs. This would vastly improve the human condition without interfering with the freedoms inherent in liberal capitalism.

Work should pay, yes, but there's no point working if no one stands to benefit. You can't get rich on an island, no matter how talented or industrious. So that's the moral case - that a product has no inherent value without access to a market, and thus the market deserves its tithe.

Practically speaking, it doesn't matter where the supply comes from - be it ten workers, or ten million - so long as the demand is there to meet it. This can be managed through the existing fiscal and monetary policy tools within a fiat currency system.

Admittedly, a full UBI is unaffordable now. It obviously can't be implemented overnight, because millions of people would definitely drop out of the labour market, and a fall in aggregate supply without a concurrent fall in aggregate demand would lead to shortages, inflation, near total economic collapse, etc etc.

The idea is that by gradually replacing our conditional welfare system with universal payments, there will be both less people willing to work unfulfilling, low value jobs and more people creating new value. So essentially, the feasibility of UBI is contingent on resulting productivity gains materialising.

Undoubtedly, some people will choose to take drugs and play video games all day. Others may well feel empowered to start new businesses. Realistically, there will be a continuum of behaviour in between, especially because current work-life balance is so dreadfully out of whack, thus diminishing returns will ensure both more free time and more shit gets done.

As you said in a comment below, when you take very large groups of people their behaviour is quite predictable and individual choices don't matter much at the macro level. The difference is I believe the sums will balance out. I believe in human ingenuity. I believe that humans inherently want to improve themselves, to create value and to be part of a social structure. Within the right systems, they will do so.

Alternatively if you need this framed in cynical terms - most UBI schemes generally advocate a subsistence level of income. We'll keep working because we're greedy and we will always want more shit.","Economic systems, Labor wages and work conditions, Non-UBI government welfare programs, Money and inflation.",gj1qryc,"For the average person, assuming it's not enough money to live off, it's for all intents and purposes taking their money off of them, wasting some on government workers or the usual useless private companies that contract for government, then giving it back to them. We might as well just selectively give money to a few people, as we do now.

If it's true UBI and people can live off of it, large quantities of people will live of it exclusively.  There is lots of evidence that much of the population don't like their jobs (but unfortunately that's life and we all have to make money to eat); if they are given the option of quitting, what will happen? Are we really expecting people not to when they say they don't like their jobs? Are we expecting people to keep flipping burgers and working shitty retail jobs? Like it or not, we need people to do these jobs.

Is it even moral for parts of the population to be living off the other parts, while not contributing to tiresome tasks? I'd argue it's anti-Liberal and LDs supporting it feels like cop out. Regardless of which side of the fence you fall on, the parts of society doing the subsiding probably won't put up with it. Look at the hatred of anyone on benefits; UBI would be much much worse.

Social safety nets make sense for everyone and are therefore a compelling argument. Giving large quantities of your income to people that give you nothing back is not a compelling argument.

The benefit though is that while many of our current welfare systems can trap people on welfare since working often ends up making less in the end given steep penalties in support as soon as a person retains employment, a basic income system is entirely additive. Every bit of work makes you more, it's just tapered in a way that allows the neediest to receive the most support while pushing up take home pay for many other lower/middle class families. 

Another benefit is that by having a guaranteed income, it affords people the ability to seek retraining that they otherwise may not have the time or resources to do otherwise.

735,"&gt;So my question is: if we forbid these companies from profiting from our harvested personal data

We don't forbid them, we simply establish that we own our data, and from that ownership we can negotiate terms and fair use from derivative products. This means Uber drivers have leverage rather than work as indentured servants. It comes down to informing people that they have leverage and from better awareness people can better negotiate contracts. It also is a problem when capitalism starts at zero and you lose your ability to negotiate when you're looking at hundreds of thousands of dollars of student loan debt and need to ensure survival for your family on a month by month basis, you're willing to sell yourself out for scraps. This will be enforceable with blockchain in the future and improved cryptographic protocols but currently it requires oversight with people that know how to use a smartphone at the very least.

You're right that you can't stymie their growth too much, which is why Yang should eventually start talking about Land Value Tax and other measures to fund UBI beyond purely weighted VAT. Decentralizing tech and businesses is ultimately the path forward though. This means giving people more ability to invest in themselves and contribute to collective ventures with fair compensation. This currently is very difficult to do when sources of advanced documentation, education, and networking is siloed into a small group of companies and universities..

There will be a compromise about how much data you wish to give up, how many trackers you are comfortable with dealing with, but this should always be a matter of convience and compensation to you rather than something imposed upon you. As far as where we see current exploitation really the only thing these companies have done with data is to make more aggressive algorithms to make you waste more of your time and money on shit you don't need. There isn't any essential emerging tech being built directly from the cat videos you like. They've used their platforms to extract wealth successfully, and now they are going into seperate ventures in automating away jobs and services off this aquired capital to take over.

We have a lot of room to negotiate what is ""too much"", but when CEOs have no idea what to do with their money other than make spaceships we are well within the green of acceptable reparations and redistribution that comes from addressing poorly negotiated contracts in how we have interfaced with their companies.

Assuming you ""scrap"" EI (everyone keeps paying premiums, but redirect them to funding Mincome instead of EI) that mitigates ~$17b, now you're at $92b.

If ""elder payments"" (OAS, supplemental, spousal allowance) is replaced by Mincome, that's ~$41b more covered. We still need $51b. What else is there?

Roll CCTB and UCCB (""child benefits"") into Mincome? That's $13b. Still short $38b.

I understand there's going to be positive effects on things like the healthcare system and other things by having people not be poor -&gt; sick -&gt; burden on healthcare, as well as wages/salaries saved by reducing the administrative overhead from having to manage all of the aforementioned programs vs one ""Mincome"" program, but *$38b is not pocket change.*

For the problem with price controls in general is they always have an effect on supply and demand see the Wikipedia article https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_controls in the criticism section.  Here it translates into a reduction of supply of minimum wage jobs, there will be more minimum wages jobs at $5 than at $15 dollars.  It also enables exploitation because a $15 worker with not UBI will be far more desparate than a worker who has $10 guaranteed and is just getting $5 from the work.  The effect is more supply of those jobs and reduced demand tipping the balance of power towards employees.  Employees can work in fields they're interested in.

And that's your position, other stakeholders may have other positions and decisions may be made by each organization. I think it is more likely that people would be retrained and re-assigned. Or they may be given a bursary to go back to college until something comes up (in which case they would be contracted to work at a reduced salary for a set period of time).


&gt;What if the the money goes into doing the work better, with less people? Then you just caught up with technological progress.

&gt;How are displaced truck drivers and coal miners and the cities that depend on their incomes being considered by multistakeholder co-ops?

- Data analysis and research
- Non-UBI government welfare programs",etu9909,"&gt; Elaborate further, how does what you describe artificial scarcity through monopolization and hoarding?

2 ways:

It raises awareness about the character of income changing hands not necessarily being down to merit (and more down to positive returns to scale that can be enclosed via property), it breaks open that narrow frame of mind in which only work could be a cause for money to change hands.

It makes the rat race a less desperate undertaking so the people doing the enclosing and doing the research to justify the enclosing can focus more on providing a better product and taking home less income as a result, because they're less pressured to take home a big income so they can pay college for their kids and then there's also retirement.

&gt; This doesn't answer the question.

Was it supposed to be an answer to that question or no???

&gt; Hmmm, the system might be able to work without money (if all organizations were consumer co-ops), although there would need to be sustainable systems of resource distribution in each organization. But we live in a heterogenous system, there are LLC's and Private corporations in the market, and in order to co-ordinate with them, money would be needed.

True. Not to forget that you don't need to incorporate to do something for your community, be social or explore either and that not every single person business needs to be a multi stakeholder co-op. So you'd consider planning economic output of the bigger corporations however real estate inflation works also due to small scale entrepreneurship. It's some kind of a crowd phenomenon. I don't really think price controls are particularly good solution in either case.

&gt; Sure, can you ELI5 why this would be a problem? You seem focused on it.

When you take a credit then there is more money chasing the same number of goods. This is a signal to other investors who see the growth in demand who in turn take out credit to buy and develop more e.g. real estate.

Like this your asset that you bought on credit unexpectedly becomes more profitable and you take more credit, expecting others to continue doing whatever they did to produce your rising asset value. What did others do again? Taking more credit. And they tend to do that as you do that as well, since your credit taking in part finances their profits.

This way prices increase faster than end-user spending grows. This works well for your bottom line and the bottom line of fellow investors small and large till rent is unbearable for the broad masses and credit taking slows down as a result.

With credit taking slowing down, less people are hired to develop more real estate and people increasingly can't pay for their overpriced mortgages also because less new credit comes in to finance the profits directly via your asset growing in value. You can draw out a resolution here e.g. by loosening borrowing standards and get those securitized subprime mortgages going but either way you get something like 2008 sometime, unless you de-leverage private debt in a more coordinated way.

Price controls are not a particularly coordinated way to resolve this issue, the issue being a lack of end-user demand to pay the fantasy prices.

&gt; Yes and the prices are not set arbitrarily. Nevertheless, you are convincing me that the only way to preserve the pricing mechanism would be to prevent consumers from unilaterally deciding the price.

Glad to hear. :D

I'm pretty open to (coordinated) printing of money instead if that's any help.

&gt; You can call it a dividend or royalty or whatever, the point is the money is coming from the labor of another. That is not a criticism its just the way it is.

Money comes into the world from taking credit and then the future is built. (Now who builds it according to whose plans is a big question.) While the capacities of the present prove to be much more dependable than anticipated, hanlding the added demand without inflation going up much. Positive returns to scale, that is being able to sell more at a falling production price point, are more often the norm than the exception.

It is paid work, unpaid work and the (unexpected) bounty of nature and technology that converge to produce the present in response to added demand.

&gt; If it is a multistakeholder co-op then it is tied to the community through the locals and consumers.

I'd just like to emphasize the great many communities we can be part of and facilitate that can produce value for us, that may or may not require a great deal of resources and pay (but do involve work) that may not be in the focus of considerations when we're playing a game involving the collection of many dollar bills as a matter of this or that credit based inflation. But true too.

&gt; They might not lay you off as part of a group because they think it would be bad for the community and economy at large.

I'm thinking not laying off people who don't really have a task to do is really bad for the person not being laid off and for the people around em.

&gt; Read this article

The reality is that output has been stable and employment prospects in manufacturing and resource extraction has been falling drastically over the past years and decades.

&gt;  “But what does that mean two or three years from now when the firm is growing and now has to ramp back up by hiring a bunch of people? Now the firm must incur all these costs to hire and train workers.”

What if the the money goes into doing the work better, with less people? Then you just caught up with technological progress. Not saying that we couldn't do that without downturns though they're definitely of use in the economy as it is. P.S. I'd really like to see statistics about this whole 'training (and hiring) people' thing as a cost factor in a real world setting.

&gt; Bullshit jobs aren't getting automated, they just get removed.

I'm still not sure about the effectiveness of the mechanism by which this'd come to be in your model especially with the human consequences in mind that is people have to now look for/do a different job that may be much worse or that may not exist (also subject to how well we manage the whole credit issue).

&gt; I have read that book, I am a consumer, I and many people who have read that book would appreciate it if they could vote for those design patterns to not be there. But they have very little agency and say.

Also not a lot of people have read it compared to how many people there are. But yeah having a process that more empowers consumers to make decisions may help there indeed!

&gt; Ofcourse, I need not be said that transparency is very important. In an economic democracy (as in any democracy), a free and open press would be very important.

This is a point I appreciate about basic income, because free and open press in the first world is a thorny topic. Too entrenched with party politics and corporate entities due to funding structures. Though more could and should be done to assure funding for independent and investigative journalism, sure.

&gt; There is no evidence of that

I mean you get money just for being alive, no compliance with a boss, no compliance with a committee. 

&gt; have any of the UBI experiments tested for that?

Entrepreneurship and community cohesion/cooperation across caste lines were up in the india trials with Guy Standing involved.

&gt; Besides, if I had to spend 2 trillion dollars a year, I would rather spend it on investing in multistakeholder co-ops than UBI.

Why not both? Also how's a multistakeholder co-op gonna help rural midwestern towns that face massive fallout of technological automation? How are displaced truck drivers and coal miners and the cities that depend on their incomes being considered by multistakeholder co-ops? They are gonna compete with Amazon or desert those places? What about Detroit, wouldn't that be a great town to live in and start a co-op given a basic income flows to all residents?

As I see it there's the capacities to give these folks a hand up and to stimulate their local economies. (The way we take stock of our economy is just really not good due to how unaware it is of private credit taking and the effects on aggregate demand that has and how unaware it is of positive returns to scale. edit: e.g. if wages are low relative to GDP/historically, chances are that we're leaving a lot of capacity to produce more/better on the table since there's no need for companies to compete much at all for workers so there's probably also not much pressure to compete in other regards. Case in point, [this study shows how much market power](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23687) has risen. If there's no real challenge we can only hope that the mega corporations are trying to become better. Or aim to socialize/democratize em and allow people to internally compete/cooperate with more transparency and legal security. edit: And/or stimulate the economy more directly although I see the potential of vertical integration and network effects and so on as its own complicated problem.)

1) how when hearing about the individual aims of the Affordable Care Act, the majority (regardless of party affiliation) resoundingly supported it.

Then if they were told that was the ACA (or ObamaCare, since a lot didn't know what the ACA was), they turned around and said that they didn't support it then.

790,Really good response. UBI has proven to be a popular concept with many otherwise libertarian folks and you explained the reason for that quite well.,"Economic systems, Labor wages and work conditions.",d0iqfg5,"Well, the obvious reason is, if you only give extra money to people who don't have jobs, they have that much less incentive to work. Let's say a person is offered a job that pays $25000 per year, but they currently receive $20000 per year in welfare; well, in that case they only end up with an extra $5000 per year if they take the job, and they might decide they'd rather have the spare time and energy instead. This is especially true if they're parents of young children, because on the one hand they'd like to spend more time with their kids, and on the other hand they'd need to have someone take care of their kids while they work, and daycare would likely cost *more* than $5000 per year. Whereas if they got $20000 per year in UBI, the job is now worth $25000 to them rather than $5000, much more appealing. (Well, it's not quite this simple because the employer probably wouldn't be able to pay the full $25000 per worker if they also had to shoulder the tax to pay for the UBI, so let's say the job now pays only $20000, still you get the idea.)

Another advantage of UBI is that simplifies the bureaucracy. You don't need to sift through everyone's accounting details, you don't need to check for people hiding their income in order to get more from the government, you just send out the cash and let people manage everything else themselves. The reduced bureaucracy means reduced operating costs for the government, which means more left over with which to make the system economically viable.

Furthermore, it could potentially allow *more* jobs to be created by removing the theoretical basis for minimum wage. The idea of minimum wage is that anyone who works at a job should make enough to live on, but with UBI, they have enough anyway, so you could eliminate minimum wage. Then, businesses that weren't willing to hire workers at minimum wage might decide to offer jobs at some new, lower rate, and people could work at those jobs without facing the risk of starving or going homeless. People could also work less of the time, for instance you could have one person doing a 2-day work week and one person doing a 3-day work week (for proportional pay) where right now you just have one person doing a 5-day work week while the other person does nothing.

Most independents are closet partisans, although they might have massive differences from the party theyre closer to. Yang is obviously closer to the democrats, but his emphases are different. His human centered capitalism is too radical for the establishment, but too ""moderate"" (I put this in quotes because it's not really moderate, they just tend to claim ""the left"") for the progressives. 

I really dont think he should budge on economics much. After all his economic platform is what drew people to him. UBI, human centered capitalism, medicare for all. Those were the cornerstones of his 2020 platform, and what his book the war on normal people was about. It's a huge appeal of yang and his brand in the first place. So, I dont think he should compromise on his core ideals much at all. 

However, on social issues, eh, I could see him moving to the center. The thing about the mainstream of the democratic party is its economically moderate and socially progressive. Whereas Yang speaks of issues and solutions the democrats wont touch, while on social issues they're insufferably far left. I consider myself on the left socially, but over the past 5 years, I just cant keep up with the democrats and their insane demands and virtue signalling.

On a lot of social issues Im more libertarian than liberal. I'm more apathetic, dont care what people do as long as it doesnt harm others, and tend to range from center right to far left depending on the issue, with my median issue being center left. 

If Yang would be similar to that I think it could be popular. Sure, back off of the illegal immigration and gun issues to some extent in exchange for gaining support for his economic agenda and reform issues. I would be fine with that. I dont think he should start sounding like a full on right winger (I feel like trumpers are insanely authoritarian and have harmful views most of the time), but I do think he could cut down on aspects of the left that most offend moderates and center right people. I feel like if democrats just downplayed those issues and focused on economics, they could be far more popular.

Incentivising useful work matters, how is this done under UBI? A higher after tax income for people who work. In the long run, toil will decrease.

And that is a good thing, and sort of the defining factor of economic progress. We toil far less than we have for most of human history. If progress is, itself, justified, then the only logical justification is that the need to toil is, itself, a natural injustice, and that progress is paying forward the sorts of advancements in technology that eliminate the need to work, from the inventors who toiled to make them, to the next generation who will not.

&gt;He also supports Medicare for all and/of public opinion. So how is trashing all social programs? You make it sound like he's libertarian rather than social progressive.

This is taken from his own campaign page: It would be easier than you might think. Andrew proposes funding UBI by consolidating some welfare programs and implementing a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of 10%. Current welfare and social program beneficiaries would be given a choice between their current benefits or $1,000 cash unconditionally.

He's trashing it by forcing people to choose. You either only get UBI and nothing else or you get the normal benefits, you can't get both which is what a true UBI would do.why do you think it's called UNIVERSAL, everyone is supposed to get it regardless of their welfare status. The TV show The Expanse has Yang's type of UBI and its dystopian because people either live off of basic and can't get anywhere in life because they have to choose between living on basic or not. There should not be any choice. You should just get it, that is what a true UBI is. 

&gt;He also supports Medicare for all and/of public opinion. So how is trashing all social programs? You make it sound like he's libertarian rather than social progressive.

Yeah ok, his websites says he would ""work with Congress to make a Medicare for all *Option.*"" You do know Obama tried the exact same thing and what did he get, really stupid, uninspired, weak insurance plan that is more a Band-Aid. And Obama had a democrat dominated Congress.

&gt;Course I have. However I believe yang is even more progressive than him. Bernie was my first choice in 2016, and second now. So not gonna argue over semantics or what progressive means. Just that when I say progressive, I mean yang is more out of the box and has more forward facing policies. Like UBI, addressing automation, his democracy dollars thing, forgiving student debt, etc etc.

If you were to plot Yang and bernie policies on a graph of how progressive they bernie would win out. As well bernie sanders also approves of a UBI but he specifically has said he would not be cutting any other social programs to get it. He would implement a true one.

&gt;These social Democrat progressive countries are pushing for UBI in addition to universal health care and education and stuff.

&gt;So is yang..

No he is not, literally from his own campaign website says he is NOT the same as bernie sanders or the Nordic progressive countries.

He also supports Medicare for all and/of public opinion. So how is trashing all social programs? You make it sound like he's libertarian rather than social progressive.

&gt;Have you never heard of Bernie Sanders? He's vastly more progressive then anything Yang has ever done.

&gt;You clearly sound like a fan of him, he's not putting humanity first if he wants to gut and remove social programs for his version of the UBI.

I am, but I am also a fan of Bernie. Again, he's not gutting them. He's giving you more choices. You can choose to keep your existing programs or choose UBI. How is having more choice regressive or bad?

How does current social programs benefit stay at home moms etc? UBI will help them and other overlooked demographics, hence humanity first and why having option to pick is the better option than JUST the current social programs.

&gt;That's because these countries are not pushing for the libertarian model of a UBI where they get rid of all other social programs. These social Democrat progressive countries are pushing for UBI in addition to universal health care and education and stuff.

Kids don't pay rent or mortgages, nor do they buy insurance, cars, gas, cable, or electricity. Kids just mostly need money for food, clothing, medicine, school supplies, etc. So they don't need the same amounts adults need, but they do need something. They just need enough to not subtract from the basics their parents require.

This is why I support in the U.S. an additional $4,000 for each and every person under 18 in addition to the $12,000 for adults. The $4,000 is arrived at using the [2014 US Federal Poverty Guidelines](http://familiesusa.org/product/federal-poverty-guidelines). From the table you can calculate that each and every kid requires an additional $4,000 to prevent the entire family from falling below the poverty line.

The fact of the matter is that we will not prevent poverty without accounting for kids as well, and if we insist on not paying for them as kids, we will pay for them later as adults, [3 to 9 times as much](http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/cphorsphc-respcacsp/2008/fr-rc/cphorsphc-respcacsp09-eng.php).

And not only are kids expensive to society if allowed to be raised in poverty conditions, they are also hugely expensive to the parents. A recent estimate places the cost of raising a kid from birth to 18 to be about [a quarter of a million dollars](http://money.cnn.com/2013/08/14/pf/cost-children/index.html). A $4,000 BI for kids over the course of 18 years amounts to $72,000.

There is also no legitimate argument for claiming UBI would worrisomely increase fertility rates. It wasn't seen in [Manitoba, Canada](http://public.econ.duke.edu/~erw/197/forget-cea%20%282%29.pdf). It wasn't seen in [the U.S. GAI experiments](http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/conf30/conf30a.pdf). It's not seen in [conditional cash transfers given out worldwide](http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/28jng8/a_popular_sentiment_on_this_sub_is_that_the_ubi/cibw237). And in fact when comparing conditional to unconditional, [unconditional saw *a reduction* in fertility rates](http://www.reddit.com/r/BasicIncome/comments/28jng8/a_popular_sentiment_on_this_sub_is_that_the_ubi/cibrit5).

Let's also compare birth rates before and after our welfare reform here in the U.S. I suggest reading these three articles from three different times to get a better idea of the results.

1997: [Doing the Math on the Welfare 'Family Cap'](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/welfare/stories/wf033097.htm)

2013: [Fertility Rate Stabilizes as the Economy Grows](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/health/fertility-rate-stabilizes-as-the-economy-grows.html)

If you do happen to read those, you will get a better idea of how weak the conclusions are that welfare reform made a difference by reducing money given.

How about more global evidence using what we have learned from conditional cash transfer programs all over the world that give more money for more kids?

Also, here's [a summary from the World Health Organization report:](http://i.imgur.com/waQZLav.png)

I would also point to Alaska and their annual dividend. Every kid there gets exactly the same amount as the adults. So what is the money spent on? What are the effects? Let's look at [the evidence](http://www.iser.uaa.alaska.edu/Publications/bien_xiii_ak_pfd_lessons.pdf) with our own eyes.

Basic income itself is the idea that we should trust people to spend a basic level of income unconditionally on what they themselves feel is best for them.

Thinking that people will not spend money for their children actually on their children, or thinking people will have children just to get an extra $4,000 even though they are already unconditionally given three times as much, and coming up with ways to attempt to prevent poor decisions in this area, is exactly the kind of thinking we're fighting against in pressing for basic income.

And finally, we seem to miss the fact that it's the wealthy with more kids, not the poor. The population of kids per household increases from the bottom of the income spectrum all the way to the top. Suggesting poor people have too many kids is already an incorrect assumption for us to begin with.

Replacing welfare with a stipend you give everyone levels the playing field by removing the help that those who need it most are getting.

If everyone gets $1,000/mo in buying power and you take away the programs that help those least able to take care of themselves, you're just pricing those people out of being able to use that $1,000 the way it's supposedly intended, which is to be spent.",Living costs,f6qt9nz,"[Here is Yang's proposal to pay for UBI.](https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq/)

1) He estimates $800 billion will come from ending current welfare programs. However, the lion's share of that $800 billion is [$500 billion in Medicaid funding](https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/blog/finance/welfare-statistics.html), which [Yang is separately proposing be covered and paid for by a Medicare for All plan.](https://www.yang2020.com/policies/medicare-for-all/) So while his left hand is promising $500 billion in savings, his right hand is claiming that we're going to continue to spend that $500 billion through a universal healthcare plan.

The remaining $300 billion is made up of a variety of programs, some of which Yang admits won't be refunded to pay for the UBI because anybody who currently draws more than the UBI from welfare can keep their welfare. 

2) Another $800-900 billion will come from ""new revenue"" derived from increased economic activity, which Yang thinks would be upwards of $2.5 trillion.

But the [US GDP is currently $20.5 trillion](https://www.bea.gov/news/2019/initial-gross-domestic-product-4th-quarter-and-annual-2018), meaning that growing by $2.5 trillion would be 10% year over year growth. The [US has averaged only 3.2% growth per year since 1948, and has struggled to average even 2% over the last ten years.](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth-annual)

Which means Yang is projecting **5X** growth overnight compared to the last ten years, and **3X** growth compared to the last 70 years of history. And that it will stick and never retract. Forever. That's outlandish, unfounded, and is exactly the sort of bullshit that the Republicans tried to argue during the tax cut debates. 

3) Yang expects a VAT to generate about $800 billion in revenue, and while this is probably the only area so far where he probably could theoretically generate the money, it has it's own set of problems. 

Yang is arguing that his UBI would spur economic activity and therefore generate tax revenue to pay for the UBI. A VAT is going to act as a wet blanket for such activity, taking out dollars just as the UBI is injecting them. It won't be a 1 for 1 ratio, obviously, but it's something that Yang's proposal doesn't seem to even take into account. 

4) The remainder of the funding gap would be filled in by a variety of other, smaller, taxes - including a mishmash of taxes on the rich, taxes on carbon, and taxes on speculative financial transactions. 

Yang doesn't even try to estimate numbers here, and just hand waves it away as being enough. 

But there's two big problems there - carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes are self defeating *by design*. Their entire point is to shrink those activities by making them less profitable. So the more you tax, the less overall revenue you get because people stop engaging in that activity. 

The problem being that Yang specifically now wants to rely on that revenue to partially fund UBI.

They reject corporatism and the consolidation of wealth and power. In particular they think we can improve capitalism with law, regulation, and social safety nets.

They also think many industries have been propped up because of bad governing policy via corporate influence called regulatory capture. This applies to many of the big industries right now: finance, tech, health, energy, and the media. They are all heading in the wrong direction because of regulatory capture.

I highly recommend the podcast https://pitchforkeconomics.com if you are interested in discussion on how corporations,  government regulation, and economic policy have eroded the good parts of 21st century capitalism. Check out the AMA episodes to get a flavor of it. They lay out arguments why M4A is necessary for capitalism and other big ideas, interviewing many economists and authors on the topic.

In particular I think Sander's support of unions and workers rights is extremely close to Yang's take on automation which is what prompted my questions. I don't think Bernie has commented on UBI or necessarily would support right now, but I think he would be the next closest candidate to such a policy.

No welfare? You think majority of starving people will just vote for that? No. Replace welfare with UBI and TAX children. That's a far more sensible move. You get enough votes. Most children will have richer parents. Only parents that can fully afford their children and pay those extra tax can have children.

Removing government? You fucking kidding me? Instead, make government behaves like corporation. Each citizen has a share. Not much change, citizens can still vote. One man is still one vote (though some guys can buy more citizenships if the country is really fucked up)

Allow people to sell citizenship. Don't like it here? Well, someone else want to get in. Okay you can rent or sell your citizenship. Perhaps people should rent first and then if they are sure they can sell.

Open border? Seriously. If you have open border, there are 1 billion chinese that will happily move. Now I know chinese are diligent and smart and stuff. But they have their own interests that don't necessarily match yours.  


What about if communist party told them to vote communism? Voting right and open border don't mix and if I can choose among 2, democracy is still more practical. There are plenty of muslims that want to turn your country into shariah.  


Instead of open border, make immigration simpler like buying and selling shares. Sell visa. If you can pay certain amount per  year, you can stay. After that you leave. A mexican want to work in US? He can just compute amount of money he will make, pay visa fee, move back out.  


It's already happening. US and many other countries ""give"" citizenship in exchange of investments. Many countries give citizenship for surrendering soldiers. It can be cheaper than killing enemies soldiers.

Tax children. Do NOT subsidize children. Can't afford them don't breed them. Every children deserve good genes, be wanted, and rich parents.

What's worse is that Doug Ford and the government will not be held accountable because he gave a tough sounding speech about how the seniors would be saved and called in the military. The reality is that the current provincial government embraced the idea of private, embraced the idea of everyone out for themselves. If you're in a nursing home you're obviously a failure in life, so why should people spend any money on you? Racism, sexism, ageism contributed to the disaster and the mindset of everyone out for themselves. But Ford has successfully convinced even his natural opponents that he's done a good job because he's ""tough sounding"" therefore he will not face any consequences at the ballot box. Compare with the actions taken in BC and you see the difference.

The only real solution is to fold long term care into the Canada Health Act and create a national long term care program. Of course we are still waiting for national childcare program, national basic income and national housing strategy. Canada's prosperity is living on borrowed time since the 60's revolution of universal healthcare and we kid ourselves if we think just because we do better than the Americans we are much better. They cannot be our standard because our goals are completely different. We are missing enormous pillars for a functioning welfare state that other countries with similar goals and population already have. Finland eliminated homelessness where are we on that?

First you will get 99% of the population that earns less than 250,000. Second UBI will be means tested meaning wealthy people or people with 'decent jobs' may get little to no income.

&gt;&gt; Further proponents tend to argue about 'savings' in eliminating every other social security program, however this ignores that if you have a disability, or some other need where you previously would have needed social security you will probably need more money than the barest minimum especially when everyone else is now going to be competing at that level of income or more

First of all UBI can run concurrent with other programs. It's only republicans or those that are against UBI that want to shut all programs to make it one giant UBI program.

&gt;&gt; If you make the amount of money offered to high you are going to have an issue with low skilled workers. If you make it low, you aren't solving the problem you claimed you would, and are going to consign those currently using various social services to destitution when they need special accommodation, but cannot afford that on their basic income. If you maintain those programs then you were just lying about an original 'benefit.'

I don't understand your point about low skilled workers. UBI is supposed to cover basic human needs. What does that have to do with low skilled workers? It's like saying nobody will have aspirations or dreams just because they are receiving UBI which obviously makes no sense.

Obviously it shouldn't be too low but it should vary according to the standard of living in different states.

&gt;&gt; In the long term UBI will eventually collapse as people will demand raising it in order to afford a better life, and then see the price of goods rise as a result and then demanding raises.

People will only ask for higher UBI to keep up with inflation. As long as it keeps up with inflation, there is no incentive to ask for more human goods than another person. I wonder why you never make the same argument with people receiving tax credits. Why they will ask for more and more. 

Plus UBI can be capped in some states but then again it would be wrong if it's not rising with inflation.

&gt;&gt;UBI is even less sustainable than current entitlements, because those are at least targeted (mostly) at those who need them. This is just targeted at everyone, even those who have no need of it

UBI can be means tested.

&gt;&gt;Finally some Gulf States kind of already do this and have seen some similar results. So this type of program is well suited to resource rich, citizen poor (meaning low population) states where the government can essentially buy support and loyalty of its citizenry on the cheap. It works fine as long as they have oil to sell, when they run out of that, they're going to have people who demand this money, and not to many ways to provide it

It's on an american that feels that because his population is big then he isn't entitled to welfare or UBI. Obviously to sustain a program like UBI we need to drastically reduce our wasted billions in defense and other areas. I think its very sustainable. And it will improve the quality of life of everyone. It will also make businesses more competitive, lead to higher wages (since they have to compete with UBI) and employees less stressed.

That has zero chance. 

No. UBI as it currently is discussed exists as this nice perfect concept where your taxes will go down, but everyone will be taken care of. You aren't going to get people on board for just handing out thousands and thousands of dollars to people, especially people who have decent jobs, or the rich themselves.

In the long term UBI will eventually collapse as people will demand raising it in order to afford a better life, and then see the price of goods rise as a result and then demanding raises. I'd guess this would take around 15-30 years (based on demands of Eastern European workers under Communism). 

Automation in the work force is newest boogeyman of the luddite. They have been talking about the evils of this forever. The pack animal will take away the jobs of the cart puller! 

UBI is even less sustainable than current entitlements, because those are at least targeted (mostly) at those who need them. This is just targeted at everyone, even those who have no need of it.

One of the benefits of UBI is it should increase mobility, and better enable people to relocate out of areas where the cost of living is too high and rents are high into areas where there is more slack in the real estate market. You'd have some upward pressures (having an extra $1000/month would likely encourage some people to move into their own place instead of having roommates, increasing demand/price) and some downward pressures (more renters could afford to buy, decreasing rental market, and more mobility to leave cities with saturated rental markets)",Living costs,ei7xok1,What I don’t understand about UBI is what’s preventing landlords from simply raising the price of rent now that people have more money in their pockets?

I would also be concerned about a carbon tax being used for the general fund (the yellow vest movement should be a lesson to the world), but the dividend system would get around that problem if implemented properly. When you responded to a question about UBI, you said it sounded great in theory, but not in practice. Would your concern to a carbon tax be similar? That a legislative body would eventually remove the dividend provision or water it down and render it ineffective? Because carbon tax and dividends, when implemented, have reduced carbon output AND actually increased disposable income for low and middle class families when factoring in energy rate increases.

I agree that lab food sources and nuclear are 2 great ideas, but those also have some problems in terms of timeliness. Lab grown food requires change in consumer preferences, consumers are notoriously picky and stubborn to change, and the change we would want to see would take many years. Same goes for Nuclear. There are fears about another Chernobyl and Fukushima (I think those fears are unfounded based on modern day technology and regulations in place), but nonetheless they do exist. They are also very time consuming to build (10+ years). The time to act on climate change is ASAP to limit warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius before 2100. The carbon tax and dividend (again I just want to re-emphasize how important the dividend aspect of this is, I know us libertarians hate taxes lol) I still strongly believe is the most effective way to implement change right now.

With a basic income, people would undoubtedly drop out of the workforce, but I really don't think it would be as many people as you'd think.

What basic income will do is increase the demand for labor towards the bottom end of the pyramid, probably drive up the wages for some jobs, and give those people locked into the shittiest of low skill positions a little negotiation power.  People on the lower end of the economy will also probably choose to work fewer hours.

Combustion engine based, industrial marketplace capitalism is over. When everything is automated, no human labor involved means no wages and we've reached peak efficiency and lowest cost for goods. People aren't going to be able to produce things more efficiently than computers,big data deep learning software, machines and robots. They work for free 24/7/365. They can produce so much more than human labor. In some cases software designed by one person can serve everybody simultaneously forever, displacing the entire costly human based industry version. 

Digital technology is subsuming all industrial technology. Weve hitmacimum efficiency and lowest cost, inflation is ok in moderation given the trade off is lifting everyone out of poverty. The delationary nature of technology means people will need less and less to get more. We can afford to QE short term as long as its going to social spending and jobs programs that will circulate in the economy, establishing a middle class and proping up the top. Energy sustainability means no more wars and financing exploring for finite resources. The future is almost free. Inflation will be irrelevant. Im certain well apl move to a global digital currency anyway.

So we have to say, what portion of this inequality am I not morally okay with?  Which portion should we, as a society, collectively act to mitigate?  And of course we have to keep in mind that any ""collective action"" is an implicit burden on anyone who disagrees with it.  Also please keep in mind that nothing can bring us to perfect equality, so we're talking about *mitigating* here, not eliminating (just to head off the straw man).

For me there are two big inequalities that I think we absolutely must act to mitigate *to the extent reasonable*:

1. Inequality in the circumstances of birth.

2. Gross inequalities in luck.

Limiting discussion to the United States (which is perhaps unreasonable, but oh well) #1 basically amounts to high quality education, paid family leave, food security, and healthcare for children.  (Oh, and clean water, which I feel like I shouldn't have to say in the US, but there you go.)  #2 is mostly taken care of by the requirement to carry certain types of insurance (home, car, etc).  Health insurance is in sort of a funny place in this country, but that should be part of the equation (could be the subject of an entire post, so if you're interested just ask).

I'm intrigued by the idea of a UBI, which could work in conjunction with some of these items to replace much of the baroque welfare system we have.  But like any great change you can't just do it all at once and hope it works.  I'd love to see some experimentation on that though.

However a lot of this is automation and a lack of demand.

The automation issue is obvious, we need less labor these days. The solution is a shorter work week at higher wages mixed with a basic income guarantee  

The lack of demand is a bit different.

Basically every single nation wants to produce goods, China, India, many nations in Africa. Europe etc but a lot of people aren't paid well enough to buy things and may of the ones that are already have enough

54,"Maximum wealth caps don't make sense in practice. 

Rarely is anyone getting 'Money' like you and I understand it. Jeff Bezos probably has only a few million at most in liquid wealth, being spent on upkeep of his properties and various personal things, something to the tune of his Amazon paper salary of $1.6 million. 

Does he deserve 1.6 million? I dunno, if you own the biggest and most successful online marketplace ever designed with one of the largest market shares, do you not deserve that kind of money?

The remainder of his *billions* in wealth, is actually locked up in the stock he owns in Amazon, his 'share' of the business and its revenue, which is worth a shitton and he liquidated a billion dollars of it once, but he doesn't have minute-to-minute ability to sell like you or I. As a major shareholder, his trades must be announced and planned months in advance to avoid causing a market crash just by tanking the stock price with the sale.

Now why does this affect a wealth cap? The answer is that his 'wealth' is tied to the value of the company. If he wants to own Amazon as the majority shareholder, he has to have 51% of the company. The annual revenue is 288 Billion, so he has to have at least 146 Billion in Amazon stock to 'own' the company. Now, Bezos doesn't own 100% of Amazon, he owns 11% as the largest individual shareholder, with the next owning less than 1% and most other investment groups owning 6% or less.

However, if Bezos *wanted* to own 51% of Amazon, if you had a wealth cap, he literally could not. The government would have to force Bezos to sell, because it's illegal for him to have too much money, that money literally being the stock in Amazon.

I think what makes sense to me is to see a Value Added Tax, as promoted by Yang and present in other countries, which taxes intracorporate spending and then funds a Universal Basic Income. Unlike minimum wage hikes, which disproportionately damage lower-income jobs and small businesses, UBI is essentially a wage floor increase rather than a wage expense increase.

By that, I mean, if you own a company and hire 60 employees to work 40 hours a week at $15/hr, you are spending 36,000 a week to pay those people, or 1.8 *million* dollars a year to pay them all. That's more than the revenue of some of these small businesses, and ignores healthcare costs, benefits, and various scales of payment between different jobs.

With a VAT and $1000/mo UBI, instead of paying $15/hr and damaging my company, my employees now make $5.77 an hour more at no cost to me, and the extra money makes them more available to work, reducing call-ins. In a family that's a collective $11.54/hr raise irrespective of job or hours worked.

John Locke stated that ""one mixes one's labor"" with previously unused/unowned resources in order for it to become his/her private property.

It all stems from ownership of yourself and your own chosen means to achieve ends. When you apply this control and use your own energy/labor to a resource you transform it out of its natural state and have in essence transferred part of your life into it and thereby ownership in it.

This is how all property is originally created. Private property ownership over these items could be voluntarily and mutually exchanged between individuals. Private property rights can also be transferred by the means of gifting.

A person that takes the ""fruits of another's labor"" (property) imposes his will over the natural property of another and deprives the other man of his freedom of action and of the full exercise of his natural self-ownership.  An aggressor interposes violence to thwart the natural course of an individual's freely adopted ideas and values, and to thwart the actions based upon such values.

62,"Exactly. This is where things get very socialistic though, as a fundamental aspect of UBI is the idea that production benefits the masses rather than the wealthy few; IE, factory jobs will be totally obsolete in 10yrs due to automation, farming for the most part is already automated &amp; getting closer to fully, retail work is close to full automation (see the amazon grocery stores, that model could be applied to almost any other store when proper shoplifting preventions are figured out) and at that point, we don't actually need everyone to have jobs to be able to produce enough resources to provide for everyone. However, in our current system the ultra-rich will control all the automation and the rest of us will be jobless, homeless, and completely screwed. This is where you get crazy situations like india banning types of automation because people weren't able to find work. 

A big example for me is doctors, my family has a few doctor friends that I've actually quizzed about issues like this before, and every one of them has said the same thing - if they were millionaires, they would still keep their job. Because they enjoy the challenge, enjoy saving lives, and making the world a better place. Same with police, firemen, teachers, etc. Most people in what we consider to be ""essential"" work do it because it is fulfilling, the job is its own reward. 

On top of this, UBI might produce several as of yet unexpected benefits - for example, 20-30hr workweek might become common. People like me, who want to work but hate wasting 40hr a week there, would love being able to maintain a good quality of life (a few steps above the people who choose not to work &amp; basically still live in poverty, just with guaranteed healthcare &amp; enough money coming in that if they spend wisely they won't starve/be homeless) and have time to do other things.

81,"&gt; I've never argued for a violent revolution, however.

Of course you did. Remember what I said? ""But let's be perfectly clear here: what you're describing is a process of taking away a vast amount of coercive power from capitalists. A reduction in coercive power means a reduction in profit and therefore wealth. Capitalists will go to war against us before they let that happen. And don't forget, they own the legislators, they own the police, and they own the military.""

You're prescribing change that will cause violent retribution from capitalists seeking to preserve their power. Which is as expected - capitalists will use violence against anyone who might reduce their profits, from strikers to protestors to journalists, as we've seen over and over again. But that means that if you actually want change, you'll need to fight for it in the face of violence. Which again, that's fine and expected: change doesn't happen without violence, whether it's strikers being killed in the process of demanding labor laws and human rights or whether it's capitalists murdering thousands upon thousands of people to increase profits for health insurance companies.

So don't delude yourself about what you're saying. You're in favor of change that will necessitate fighting back against capitalist violence.

And consider that the change that you're willing to fight capitalists for is change that will *leave capitalists in power.* It's as bad as talking about a war to depose a king in order to replace him with his brother.

&gt; My position is more nuanced.

""Nuanced"" is an overly generous description. You see the need for change because you recognize that capitalism is evil, but you refuse to consider change because you insist that capitalism is good. Your aspiration is to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic. That's not so much nuance as it is failure.

&gt; The way you view things it's like a binary, either you have capitalism or you don't, and there is nothing in between, no shades of gray at all. I've never held that position myself.

That'd be because your understanding of capitalism is poor, as you established quite clearly in our earlier discussion. In fairness, you have more understanding of capitalism than most Americans do, but that's an easy bar to clear since it's laying on the ground.

You recognize many of the symptoms of capitalism, which is why you wish to change it. But you shy away from understanding why those symptoms are created by capitalism and why they've always been created by capitalism since capitalism was invented, preferring instead to pretend that capitalism is simply misunderstood and that you have the ability to unlock its heart and turn it into a good boy. Capitalism creates and enforces poverty because the profit motive demands it. Poverty is not an accident or a misunderstanding. It's capitalism working as intended. It's possible to mitigate some tiny amount of poverty within capitalism, such as with a UBI. It isn't possible to *eliminate* poverty within capitalism, because without a vast impoverished army of desperate workers willing to be stolen from in order to stay alive, profit will dry up and capitalism will cease to exist.

If you waved a magic wand and got exactly the changes you wish for, the very next day the capitalists that you allowed to stay in power would begin undermining, sabotaging, and fighting your changes. It might take them years, but the incentives of capitalism are constant: profit is the only goal, and profit requires harm. The capitalists would eat away at your changes bit by bit until eventually we'd be back in the conditions we're in right now, with capitalists pushing for making things even worse, because maximizing profit requires maximizing harm.

The better world you seek can't be found within capitalism. It's that simple.

&gt; I not only understand my beliefs, I even understand your beliefs for you as well. I am doing the work of two here by myself.

88,"Will you consider a small global basic income, simply affected, where the many typical complaints and concerns are moot?

Firstly, the current stream of income to provide the global BI is ethically ours, anyway, so there is no redistribution involved, just the proper distribution of option fees.

The stream of income, the largest single stream of income, is the interest paid on sovereign debt, globally. Which is also the cost of money creation. Which is the option fees for access to human labor.

Can you see how no welfare scheme can affect significant change while money creation, and any aspect of our global economic system may be manipulated at will by a few?

That largest stream of income is the inequitable thing affecting growing global inequality, \[because it is owed to each human, but collected by a few.\]([https://medium.com/@stephenstillwell/why-should-we-not-include-each-in-money-creation-b581c7dedeef](https://medium.com/@stephenstillwell/why-should-we-not-include-each-in-money-creation-b581c7dedeef))

It's owed to us because we are the guarantee of value, like gold was supposed to be, but wasn't, the interest is ours.

The most tragic part of dismissing our right to this income, is continuing to withhold access to economic abundance. By including each adult human equally in the process and profit of money creation, we provide ubiquitous access to sustainably priced financing for any project needed or demanded by any population, globally. Including secured loans for home, farm, or secure interest in employment to each sovereign individual on the planet.

This is simply accomplished by allowing each adult human to go to their bank, sign a local social contract, and claim an equal Share of the fiat credit money is created from, and place it in trust with their bank.

Then, when money is created by loaning it into existence, it will be borrowed from our Shares and the interest paid directly and equally to us. By assigning a fixed value to a Share, we limit money creation to a per capita maximum, and by fixing a sovereign rate below sustainable growth, we fix the value of all money. Without significant change to activities of daily living.

This way we provide parity in money creation to each human, each community, each government, based only on our agreement to cooperate in this venture.

No one is given anything, there is no redistribution, it provides equal access to sustainably priced money for secure investment globally, eliminates the bond market and fractional reserve banking, and distributes a global BI that's functionally free, because it's paid with the sustainable interest we pay to create and maintain money.

So, what objection?

Now you could just give people less money, but that wouldn't be enough to live off of, so you couldn't scrap other entitlements to help pay for it.  So if we implemented UBI, it wouldn't be as an alternative to other forms of welfare, as it wouldn't be able to replace them.

So basically we can't afford UBI.

One argument for UBI is that our current wage-slavery means that people are stuck doing make-work: jobs that could be better done by robots or kiosks, but we have this idea that everyone's worth is measured in their income-earning potential, so we have low-wage jobs instead. UBI would free people up to do things that really call to them, like the arts, like raising their kids, researching important questions, and so on. We would be able to innovate and create \*more\* because people wouldn't be trapped in jobs that soak up a quarter of their time and half their energy. 

That said, education is an important question. I like the system that is brought up in The Expanse series: everyone (well, except ""the undocumented"") is eligible for Basic, but if you want to get educated and have a career, you first have to prove that you're willing to work at something. So you need to hold a wage-earning job for a year or more to ""earn your credits"" and go to university. 

As for your point about math, though, that's already been addressed. The way we teach math has fundamentally changed. Kids are no longer taught the most efficient set of steps to compute a correct result; they are instead taught ""number sense,"" or how numbers relate to each other in more abstract ways, with a whole lot of emphasis on how to ask the right questions. This is \*crucial\* when they'll be relying on computers to spit out the correct answers, because someone still has to input the correct operands and program the right computations.

Bravo.",Economic systems.,efvw9ue,"Yesterday, I went on a bit of a rant to my husband about how, on the one hand, it sucks that we are categorized as ""disordered"" because our hardwiring makes us less effective and consistent when it comes to ""productivity."" This took me down the rabbit hole of why capitalism is inherently hostile to neurodivergent brains, and how much universal basic income would, like, *change everything.* If there were a way to live and be a positive member of your community while being able to take time off work when needed, or change jobs frequently without loss of stability, maybe ADHD wouldn't feel like such a life sentence, and we could more readily enjoy some of the things our brains are *better* at than neurotypical brains, and could actually use these differences to greater overall benefit to our communities.

See, because I WANT to contribute. I hate that the measure of my contribution is evaluated in terms of *consistency* and *productivity*\--the first of which is basically not a thing for me, and the second of which happens in dramatic bursts and fits. I want to give back. I don't enjoy my shortcomings, and I hate feeling trapped by them. While universal basic income sounds like a way to re-shape the system, I am not delusional enough to believe it's something I'll experience in my lifetime. While I like to get real down on capitalism (it's one of my favorite rants), I also know that there is no point or purpose in rejecting the circumstances of my reality--this is the world I get to work with, right now. This is the brain I get to work with. These are the facticities of my reality.

AND SO! ON THE OTHER HAND! Thank fucking god for capitalism and stigma, in a way, because it incentivised pharmaceutical companies to develop medications that allow us to function at or closer to NT levels when it comes to conventional ""productivity."" We were a problem that needed fixing. And that means that I have way more options, right now, at this moment in time, than I would have had sixty years ago when our hardwiring was certainly present in the population, and the expectations of ""productivity"" were certainly no less than they are now. My dad didn't have these options, and he is my shining beacon of exactly how I don't want my life to end up--deep in debt, divorced, jobless, depressed. I want to have kids of my own, and I want to give them opportunities to explore as much of our wild and wonderful world as they can or want to. Having access to medication, right now, at this moment in time, makes that possible.

But my husband and I are also working on our dream to live off the land on a fully self-sufficient, fully off the grid homestead. That's our hopeful early retirement plan.

Further, people on UBI will be less likely to take difficult jobs and less willing to work long hours. I am not against a UBI but I don't see it as a way to bring back manufacturing jobs; if anything, it will bleed them away faster. Anything that makes a human less controllable than a robot will lose manufacturing jobs.

As for the super-automation scenario, no it won't bring factories closer because you have to consider the impact of technology on all sectors, not just on the manufacturing sector. The increasing impact of tech on the communication sector will mean you can put a robot factory anywhere in the world and still have it closely monitored by experts in the West. And you will probably want to do just that, because it will be cheaper to *build* that factory in the third world. (Robots don't require a wage once built, but they do need to be built as well as the factory itself, and it helps a whole lot if *that* human labour is incredibly cheap.) And there are also taxes. Third world countries often give corporations the kind of tax shelters they could only dream of in the West.

There is only one genuine long-term solution and that is to turn the third world into another first world. But it won't be pursued because it involves untenable political sacrifice (short-term lowering of living standards in the West), it involves giving up the exploitative one-way resource-sucking relationship the West has with the ever-'developing' (but somehow never actually 'developed') world, it involves no longer supporting dictators against their own people, it involves no longer starting adventurist wars to 'protect American interests' at the expense of those other people's interests. In our increasingly shrinking world, the only *real* way to prevent third-world labour from destroying first-world labour markets, in the long run, is to make sure third world labour has as much power as first world labour to bargain for its own interests. And that's the one thing you can probably be certain won't happen.

The American imperial experiment is doomed to destroy the American standard of living. It's just a matter of how fast.","Automation and jobs, Economic systems, Labor wages and work conditions.",dc0xyj8,"There are at least three possible solutions to this:

Closed economies. Instead of an international market, go back to import taxes and bet that while things get more expensive in the short term, the increased wealth of the lower and middle class because of high employment is a better long-term investment than factories in China.

Super-automation. As robots continue to become more reliable, cheaper, and more general, at one point it becomes better to have the factory near the technicians rather than the technicians near the factory. High tech stuff like car assemblage, chip manufacturing machine production, scientific equipment, etc., already need so much skilled labor that it's better to have those factories in the first world. The few unskilled jobs that can't be automated would be done by first world workers, which is an expense, but it doesn't weigh up against the better quality of skilled laborers.

Universal basic income, or some other system where employees get subsidised by the government rather than relying on a minimum wage OR welfare to meet costs of living. Instead of corporations having to foot the bill for higher standards of living when they hire a minimum wage employee, the government tax it from everyone who wants to do business in these largest economies in the world.

127,"Sanders &gt; Warren. Her plan is garbage so it’s not worth discussing. 

You don’t take into account that the poorest of the poor who are on welfare and still considered unemployed or underemployed making $900 off welfare would only see a net benefit of $100 where if the minimum wage was bumped they would be seeing more of a benefit. 

Plus the inflation that would take place. 

Plus Yang wants to eventually do away with these entitlements and replace them entirely with this capitalist handout rather than services rendered. No thank you. Yang isn’t for Medicare for all. He’s not for Free college (neither is Warren). 

Too many holes in his plan and just jotting the numbers down on paper does not equate to it actually being a viable option. 

I only support the UBI if it’s in addition to things like welfare and SSI and disability, not in lieu of. We need to raise the benefit substantially not call it something else and rob Peter to pay paul. 

I am for one day doing a UBI but people would need to own the means of production. Simply giving peasants money to give to their landlords and business owners is not the future we need but to rather own the businesses and resources and means of production so money isn’t an issue. 

Yang’s UBI is a very tepid and poor approach to a much more complicated problem that requires a more complicated solution such as the reworking of structure of ownership. This is why I like bernie’s wealth tax. We need to start taking this all back from them and beefing up the private sector. Giving people $1,000 to spend on bullshit while we are being ripped off left and right does nothing except exacerbate an already dire problem.","- Non-UBI government welfare programs
- Taxes",feoaoxh,"Absolutely!  Glad to share.  This is a comparison to Warren's plans, which is not only a $15/, but also includes free college, and free child care:

Actually, the Ubi would more than surpass $15 minimum wage increase in much of the country

Let's run numbers

Maryland: min wage is $10.10

40 hr wk * $10.10/hr * 4 weeks = $1616/mo

Yang: 1616+1000= $2616/mo

Warren: 40 x 15 x 4 = $2400

The scales tilt in Yang's favor for CA, NY, AZ, AR, CO, CT, DE, DC, HI, ME, MA, MI, MN, NE, NJ, OH, OR, RI, SD, VT, WA, and WV

Most of the interior states have lower wages, so Warren's plan would help them more - if they had jobs. Unfortunately these regions have the highest rates of people out of the workforce, and they would not benefit under Warren as much as they would for Yang.

Let's look at a median state: Florida Minimum Wage: 8.46

Yang: 8.46 x 40 x 4+1000=$2353

Warren: $2400

For the single adult, this seems to tilt in Warren's favor. But if that adult takes a vacation, misses work, gets sick, the balance quickly tilts towards Yang

If that adult has a spouse who is staying home with the kids, how do those numbers change?

Warren: $2400/ (+TANF (250), so let's say total comp $2650

That same household under Yang? $3400/

That's an extra $9k a year.

Holy shit. I have to admit I had never actually run the numbers on that specific scenario. The difference is astounding.

Even if we factor in child care ($750/ mo), it makes the plans even. But once that kid hits kindergarten, the scales tip back to Yang

Economic downturn? $15 min wage means nothing to the jobless. A Ubi does.

If you run the numbers in a variety of scenarios - single adult worker who wants vacation time, young family with a child, someone who loses their job, someone who wants to learn a trade or relocate, someone who wants to start a business, caregivers for children, retirees on SSI, caregivers for retirees, on and on, the data strongly shows Yang's policies to be more beneficial than a $15 min wage or her other policies

Want to look at college?

Let's take that same family. From grades 1-12, the family makes +$9k a year under Yang

By the time their kid is set to enter college, Yang's family has increased wealth of $108k compared to Warren.

Florida University is ~7k a year. So that's a total cost of 28k

108-28 = 80k

Yang's plan would be more beneficial by a tune of $80,000+

And if that kid doesn't want to go to college? Instead he wants to start a business or enter a trade? He sees zero benefit of the free college, but Yang's plans give him a foundation to grow on.

Plus, if the single mom you refer to likes her benefits - She can keep them!  Yang's plan is opt-in, so she would not lose any benefits unless she felt his plan is better.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

132,"Ok, inflation and VAT and UBI.   This is a really common question and concern.   With a 10% VAT, the worst case scenario is that there will be a one-off 10% jump in inflation.   First reason that won’t happen, is that the most common goods won’t be included in Yang’s VAT.   It will be a ‘progressive VAT’ version that excludes basic necessities such as housing, healthcare, utilities, food, children’s clothing, diapers and personal hygiene products, medications etc.   Excluding these takes a big chunk out of its inflationary effect.

Secondly, 130 nations have already introduced a VAT, and on average businesses ate half the VAT tax, and only passed on half to the consumer.   So with a 10% VAT, non necessities are most likely to undergo a 5% one off hike in price, rather than 10%.   Many people are concerned that with businesses ‘knowing’ that everyone has $1k extra, they’ll rise their prices dramatically.    At the moment competition stops large price hikes in every but three markets:  healthcare, education and housing.   Yang has large plans for each of these sectors to cut costs dramatically.

Even without federal intervention, the Freedom Dividend alone will mean 5% of renters will be able to afford their first homes.  It is possible that 5% of renters will exit the market in 1 to 2 years, and landlords in some areas will actually be lucky if they don’t have to lower rent to attract renters.

Everywhere else, if businesses try to price gouge, other businesses will simply ‘steal’ their customers by not price gouging.   People are even going to have more money for transport to travel further if their local businesses all try price hiking at once.

Technology is firmly in play reducing and holding down the costs of goods and services as businesses upgrade their software and hardware over time, increasing productivity.   And new start ups come and disrupt established services with apps on an increasing basis.   So ongoing technological improvement and disruption will be an ongoing counter-weight to the likely one-off 5% inflation of non-necessities.",Taxonomy: Taxes.,etk7phs,"&gt;Its more so around 2.1 trillion

140,"&gt;Or to close the shop and move to Vietnam, and then there are less jobs and less tax income from wich to pay a basic income.

You are right, let's do a full incentive analysis. 

With more disposable income, the consumers will be able to buy more goods, increasing demand and therefore income for the businesses. The net result is that they will be better able to afford to hire workers rather than cutting every corner.

Also, by allowing the workers to choose when to work and not be forced to work, many of the other regulations that are needed currently to protect workers from abuse will not need to be as strict (because a worker can just quit), which means that it will be easier, not harder, to start a new business, further increasing economic growth. Workers will also have more opportunities to quit their job and start their own businesses. Employers will also be able to fire inefficient workers easier because it won't result in that worker being put out in the street. The basic income system is essentially a base of socialism that provides a foundation for a fairly libertarian economic system on top of it. We already have a base of socialism as a foundation (e.g. minimum wage, regulations, unemployment insurance, welfare), as do all modern capitalist countries, so I am just proposing a simpler and what I believe is a more flexible and effective approach. Essentially, it corrects a market failure in the labor market (the fact that workers are people and therefore have to have a ""price floor"" enforced by the government to survive and not live in absolute poverty), and then lets the free market do the rest.

As for moving the jobs to Vietnam: I really don't care. Let them. All the US government has to do is close tax loopholes and actually enforce trade agreements (e.g. no currency manipulation and do not trade with countries that are extremely abusive to workers) to make sure that companies and foreign governments are not abusing international imbalances. I actually like outsourcing because it will make Vietnam richer in the long run and therefore reduce global imbalances. This has already happened in South Korea, Japan, and is currently happening in China (look up the ongoing Honda strike and the Foxconn labor issues, both which will result in higher wages for Chinese workers). My hope is that in the long run, everwhere from Vietnam to Uganda can be made richer with outsourcing. Free trade is a very good thing in the long run. Meanwhile, the western workers can take advantage of the basic income system to go back to school and acquire skills that are useful in their country rather than rot with obsolete skills in industries that will soon be outsourced.

You have to understand that the threat of jobs moving under a basic income system is irrelevant. Jobs are already moving with our current system and most of the unskilled labor jobs will be gone in the long run due to computers and robots. Even the unskilled labor in Vietnam won't be necessary in the long run. The basic income system is designed with the long term in mind. In the long term, intellectuals will still have jobs (e.g. scientists, engineers, lawyers, business leaders), but unskilled workers will be unimportant to the economic system (one could argue this is already the case). When unskilled workers cannot find employment, should they starve or should they be allowed to be consumers? These people still want to live and consume, which creates demand for our capitalist system. Overall, the reason I support basic income is that higher technology should make people richer, not poorer.","Economic systems, Labor wages and work conditions, Non-UBI government welfare programs, Business and profit.",c0rcgg5,"""Then, businesses would be forced to pay a reasonable wage for workers because otherwise workers would have no incentive to work.""

152,"It's weird, for every argument there's an opposite argument that's just as plausible:

Pro: not having to work to survive puts more bargaining power in the hands of workers as you can simply turn down low-paid work.  
Con: a guaranteed income for all means businesses can get away with paying people less, as it no longer needs to be enough to sustain the worker.

Pro: it will increase the standard of living for everyone and eliminate poverty in one step  
Con: your livelihood is now controlled by the government, and if they decide not increase UBI payments at least in line with inflation, it could plunge millions into dependency on unstable low-paid work, becoming nothing more than an expensive replica of the current system. Without adequate taxation it could also lead to a hyper-inflation scenario. Additionally, without adequate rent controls or affordable housing projects, most of the money will simply disappear into the pockets of private landlords.

Pro: it massively simplifies the welfare system, as every citizen gets the same amount of money.  
Con: it could leave disabled people in a worse situation - some form of means-tested benefit will still need to exist, with all the same issues as current systems.","- Labor wages and work conditions

&gt;If Trump is defeated, what is left of the GOP establishment might try to effect a restoration of the old economic dogma of free trade, mass immigration and entitlement cuts. But sooner or later, a Republican Party platform with policies that most of the party’s core voters reject will be revised or abandoned—over the objections of libertarian Republican party donors and allied think tanks and magazines, if necessary.

***

&gt;Why is this all happening now? Because the decades-long “culture war” between religious conservatives and secular liberals is largely over.

&gt;Most culture-war conflicts involve sexuality, gender, or reproduction (for example, abortion, contraception, LGBT rights, and same-sex marriage). The centrality of culture-war issues in national politics from the 1960s to the present allowed both major parties to contain factions with incompatible economic views. For a generation, the Democratic Party has included both free traders and protectionists — but support for abortion rights and, more recently, gay rights have been litmus tests for Democratic politicians with national ambitions. Conversely, Republicans have been allowed to disagree about trade and immigration, but all Republican presidential candidates have had to pay lip service to repealing Roe v. Wade and outlawing abortion.

&gt;Social issues spurred a partisan realignment by changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans. Over decades, socially conservative working-class whites migrated from the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party, especially in the South. Socially moderate Republicans, especially on the East Coast, shifted to the Democratic coalition. Now, there’s little disagreement within each party on social issues. Liberal Republicans are as rare as Reagan Democrats.

&gt;Like an ebb tide that reveals a reshaped coastline, the culture war remade the parties’ membership and is now receding. In its absence, we are able to see a transformed political landscape.

&gt;The culture war and partisan realignment are over; the policy realignment and “border war” — a clash between nationalists, mostly on the right, and multicultural globalists, mostly on the left — have just begun.

***

&gt;The outlines of the two-party system of the 2020s and 2030s are dimly visible. The Republicans will be a party of mostly working-class whites, based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere. They will favor universal, contributory social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effort—programs like Social Security and Medicare. But they will tend to oppose means-tested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoy.

&gt;They will oppose increases in both legal and illegal immigration, in some cases because of ethnic prejudice; in other cases, for fear of economic competition. The instinctive economic nationalism of tomorrow’s Republicans could be invoked to justify strategic trade as well as crude protectionism. They are likely to share Trump’s view of unproductive finance: “The hedge-fund guys didn’t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.”

&gt;The Democrats of the next generation will be even more of an alliance of upscale, progressive whites with blacks and Latinos, based in large and diverse cities. They will think of the U.S. as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large. Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world, equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascism.

&gt;The withering-away of industrial unions, thanks to automation as well as offshoring, will liberate the Democrats to embrace free trade along with mass immigration wholeheartedly. The emerging progressive ideology of post-national cosmopolitanism will fit nicely with urban economies which depend on finance, tech and other industries of global scope, and which benefit from a constant stream of immigrants, both skilled and unskilled.

&gt;While tomorrow’s Republican policymakers will embrace FDR-to-LBJ universal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare, future Democrats may prefer means-tested programs for the poor only. In the expensive, hierarchical cities in which Democrats will be clustered, universal social insurance will make no sense. Payroll taxes on urban workers will be too low to fund universal social insurance, while universal social benefits will be too low to matter to the urban rich. So the well-to-do in expensive, unequal Democratic cities will agree to moderately redistributive taxes which pay for means-tested benefits—perhaps even a guaranteed basic income—for the disproportionately poor and foreign-born urban workforce. As populist labor liberalism declines within the Democratic party, employer-friendly and finance-friendly libertarianism will grow. The Democrats of 2030 may be more pro-market than the Republicans.",Political affiliations.,epkoomw,"You've gotten several good responses but I'd still like to weigh in. I think it's a combination several factors. 

I think the biggest factor is the concentration of both the media, and both party establishments in overwhelmingly ""blue"" enclaves. namely the DC/NYC corridor and coastal California. It's something of a running joke that any randomly selected office, church, or bar, along the [I-10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10) is likely to be far more ""integrated"" in terms of race, class, gender, religion, etc... than any silicon valley boardroom, yet somehow *we're the ones with the problem*. You don't see this on FOX News or CNN because no one on FOX News or CNN spends much time outside their bubble if they can avoid it.

The next biggest issue is that that the socially-conservative/religious right in the US tends to take a dim view of anything that pattern matches to ""sins of the father"". This puts them at a disadvantage when it comes to citing past glories or arguing against the intersectional left and their fellow travelers in the alt-right. Such arguments are, as others have noted, not considered particularly convincing.

Finally there is, for lack of a better term, the ""tribal"" aspect. If the WASPy GOP establishment is not going to look out for ""bitter clinger"" interests why should the bitter clingers look out for theirs? 

As someone who's been active in state/regional politics I feel like the US has been undergoing something of a paradigm/coalition shift. The Democrats seems to have purged most of their more socially conservative members many of whom have been absorbed by the GOP, triggering something of an identity crisis as the party re-orients from a free-market global/economic focus to a more social ""home and hearth"" one. By the same token many of the big corporate sponsors seem to be getting ""woke"" these days so I expect libertarians and the ""alt-right"" will eventually find their way into the Democratic party.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
