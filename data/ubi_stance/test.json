There are two major issues at play here: the economy is locked into a phase that is taking wealth from the lower 75 percentile and transferring it to the elites. The problem with this is that the lower 75% have a much greater propensity to consume than does the elite. Less consumption. The second issue is automation which can be considered a mechanism to drive down wages, this also causes decreased consumption because of the lack of funds.

Right now, we have power in society because we're the people who make all the stuff and our greatest weapon against capital is the ability to withhold our labor. Automation in the hands of the capitalists erodes that power. If we use UBI as a way to make it ok that people can't work, it acts as a pacifier where the real insidious nature of privately-controlled automation is obfuscated. We need to be pushing for more worker control and worker ownership now while we still have power to wield. The future I envision, which is enabled by UBI is one where there is a permanent underclass of pure consumers and a permanent overclass who own the production and require only a small percentage of input from the lower class. In this society, the majority of us are literally useless to the people who decide who gets food, and we have no power to wield if they cut us off. It's better to keep as many people involved as possible and cut working hours than it is for a portion of the population to be workers and a portion to be full-time consumers, both dependent on capital and likely even further divided. Healthcare, jobs and housing are all great, but the crux of the issue is getting a piece of the pie in terms of production to ensure that we don't realize the distopian future of privatized automation.",

I hope they dont make that foolish mistake again, but our leadership are silly blind fools. They've wasted a lot of time dealing with this with their Pollyanna bullshit. Yes and also, the economic pain felt by many people around the world is real. I think that they should NOT have press-ganged state unemployment relief offices, which are already going to be pretty limited by fucking Republicans that have pared back govt over and over in almost every state (because muh taxes are 1% too high on the 1%), and also because we have typically got govt typically under any leadership Dem or Repub, that is badly led and not really ready for crisis. The state workers are probably not the problem and there are probably some career workers that could fix the situation and sort it all out in 3 months but we dont have 3 months. To rub salt in the wound, of course the Fed bails out Wall St and banks but has no plans for Main St nor individual citizens.\n\nAnd so just so you know, I have to add that either they should have bailed out individual citizens or no one. And then if individual citizens, they should have simply given UBI based on a percent of your tax returns last year. With the understanding that whatever you involuntarily take from that UBI will be adjusted, live, and taken out of your paycheck - if you still have a job right now. So someone like me, with a job would see no difference in income. But my employer would see a virtual payroll cut for my line item, with the govt making up the difference (to them, as if I got a furlough). For a different business who laid off their workers, their workers would straight get some percentage of last years salary, at least 80%\n\nOR I would support a mortgage, rent freeze, and even commercial mortgage freeze, all the way up to the banks. Money is made up, let the banks eat the loss.\n\nAlso, I am white hot mad at China about this, but will never vote Trump. Thank you\n\nAlso, thank you health care workers and scientists and other front line types that are trying. The least everyone else can do is stay home and not get sick. The little bit of time we've given ourselves - MAYBE - has resulted in us figuring out that Remdisivir shortens ICU stays from 11 days to 4. So that's something.

Tbh I don't know why UBI would hide pricing information other than maybe producers\/sellers jack up prices to match everyone's increased incomes.\n\nThe thing about the cost of US welfare programs means that they are reducing the total output of the US economy (GDP) meaning without the welfare we have in the US today, everyone would be better off as would our economy as a whole. I would love to see the source for the numbers he gave though, would be an interesting read.\n\nThe Gini index is basically the thing that tracks income\/wealth inequality, the lower the value the better with the idea being that wealthier nations have the lowest values in the index. What he is saying is that the US has been trending down (good) on the index but welfare programs have caused a reversal in this causing the US to trend up again (also would be interesting in reading the source for this).\n\nTo sum it up, he's saying he disagrees with UBI and that it would make the US worse off.\n\nI do want to add my two cents into this though, I and many other libertarians see UBI as a pragmatic way to transition away from the welfare state we are today. Saying we could just turn off welfare overnight and everything would be fine is being ignorant at best. \n\nHaving UBI replace welfare is a good transition because its universal, everyone gets it regardless of income so there is no 'cutoff' like there is with welfare today where once you make more than a certain amount then you are no longer qualified for welfare. This of course incentivizes people to stay under certain income levels so they remain qualified for welfare benefits. With no cutoff, people are free to work up the income ladder without purposefully shooting themselves in the foot and still get benefits. \n\nAlso $2k a month is too much, I like Andrew Yang's idea of $1K\/month where you can opt out of it (because if youre already in the upper middle class or higher, getting an extra $12k\/year wouldnt be as big of a deal to you) as well as making people choose between welfare and UBI (so you can only receive one or the other) and the idea would be that enough people would eventually choose UBI that you could remove other welfare entirely. \n\nAs for paying for it, removing other forms of welfare, reducing military budget, plus any other gov spending would open plenty of room for UBI. The problem of course is when and how to phase out UBI because it is meant as a transitionary program. That is question I don't really have an answer too, unfortunately.",

Big transitions generally happen during harsh crises, precisely because refusing to change would yield even greater short-term catastrophes.\n\nAbout fast-foods: IIRC, wages represent about 10% of their expenses, so doubling salaries without automating anything means an extra dollar on your $10 menu. Hardly a game changer: employers squeeze their employees into borderline-misery just because they see no reason not to. The operational mode you describe (1 skilled technician maintaining a bunch of robots) is pretty much how car factories operate today: it hasn't bankrupt them, and cars are more affordable than when they were built manually.\n\nThe basic innovation of supermarkets, compared to traditional shops, was to let you help yourself to your purchases: salespersons only take care of checkout and payment. That's already a form of automation. In Europe, many supermarkets go one step further, and offer self-checkout registers to trusted customers: you bip your articles yourself, either while shopping with a wireless scanner or at the checkout, and pay with your credit card. 1 register attendant typically manages half a dozen machines, helping and occasionally controlling customers when needed. It's faster, probably less strenuous for the employee, and cheaper. Everyone wins, except the employees who've been let go.\n\n(And we never have grannies packing our stuff behind the register: not only wouldn't it be cost effective, but we have minimum guaranteed pensions, so they don't have to do that to pay their dogfood).\n\n&gt; assuming that the machine were cost effective.\n\nMachine tend to *become* cost effective, at scale. Once the R&amp;D has been amortized, what's the bill of material for a machine? Seldom more than a couple years' worth of minimum salary. Don't forget, we already live in a world where it's easier to extract oil from the soil, turn it into a plastic spoon, chip it, sell it, throw it and recycle it than washing a friggin' metal spoon. Automation becomes very cheap as it scales up.\n\n&gt; The fact that I'm still interacting with those people tells me that it's not yet cost effective to replace them with machines.\n\nMostly because people doing those jobs are barely paid enough to survive. Small change we could afford to offer them as a basic income. Again, go in Europe, you'll find that many of your jobs have been automated away, yet associated services aren't more expensive than in the US.\n\nAnother factor in many countries--I'm not familiar enough with US politics to give good examples but you'll surely find some--is that voters want jobs, even pointless ones; as a result, politicians issue regulations which maintain those pointless jobs alive. For instance, I've heard that filing your taxes in the US requires a software, if not an accountant; in most of Europe, all it takes is a signature on a pre-filled form, optionally online. Do you think your accountant and tax software developers create actual wealth and contribute to make a better world?\n\n&gt; &gt; \"Moreover, the idea was to take back most of the 20K back as new taxes anyway, [from] people with good wages.\"\n\n&gt; This bothers me. You're saying that if I manage to make myself more valuable than other people, I'm going to be penalized for that value\n\nNo. You're not valuable by yourself. You make money in a context provided by society: with no proper roads, no social peace, no security, no educated employees, and most importantly not enough customers with disposable income, you can't make money. So part of the money which appears on your bottom line morally belongs to the whole society around you. Which proportion exactly, it's the politicians' job to decide.\n\nIf you make 6 figures designing video games, you can only do so because millions of people have disposable time and income to spend on them. The more we automate things, the more money gets concentrated: a couple of super-rich machine owners, and an army of starving useless people. Apart from the fraction of percent happy few at the top (and that's supposing they're complete psychopaths), nobody benefits from this equilibrium.\n\nGet rid of redistribution, and the only businesses which keep thriving are farmers and arm dealers. You need to feed back the society that feeds you, especially if you're on the top. Paying 30% of $200K rather than 5% of $40K is a bargain for that (figures totally made up, but you get the point).

I ALSO think there isn't a snowflake's chance in hell of it becoming available in your lifetime, mine, or that of our grandchildren. It is what it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry it this way: we don't get to choose the era we're born into, or the circumstances. All we can do is grab life by the balls and get the most we can out of what's available to us at the moment. I had an interesting conversation a couple of weeks back with a young man who graduated from medic school with me last month. He's a black guy from a shit neighborhood, and he applied for a grant from the workforce center to pay for his training. He talked about the things he wants for himself, his wife, and his young son, which are mostly the same things the people he grew up with want. What he said was frustrating to him, looking at his childhood friends (many of whom are in jail or working dead-end jobs), is that these things are AVAILABLE. But you have to get the fuck up and take it.\n\nThis applies to anything, including all the various forms of dropping out. I don't think anybody is likely to just GIVE you the money to drop out; things have to get much worse than they are before even a token UBI becomes a reality. Dropping out has to be earned. The good news? I've done it, and it's not that fucking hard. It's mostly a matter of opportunism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a whole world of shit out there that you can have, more than enough to compensate for the things you can't have. But you can't get married to a specific vision. One must be opportunistic, and learn to say it is what it is and mean it.",

The key point here is they can choose. So if you're on welfare of some kind, you could fall into 1 of 3 categories:\n\n* Remain on welfare because your current benefits are better than UBI (in this case, $1k\/mo)\n* Switch to UBI even though your current benefits offer more monetary value, because there's no restrictions on how you can spend it. That autonomy might be worth the difference for some people.\n* Switch to UBI because you'd get more than your current benefits.\n\nThis doesn't mean existing welfare programs need to be shut down (and I don't think Yang has suggested that either but correct me if I'm wrong). They'll still need to exist for the people who depend on them, we can't just kick em out. But ideally enough people *choose* to go for UBI. More people on UBI and less on welfare means less bureaucracy but not at the cost of efficiency, which is a win-win.\n\n&gt; Once the previous suite of welfare policies have been eroded, now there\u2019s only one redistributive program to attack and resources can be dedicated to destroying that after everything else is decimated\n\nIf UBI results in other welfare programs getting phased out over time, it's a bit of a leap to say now everyone's going to come for it. If anything it just solidifies the UBI system as even more crucial. It's hard to envision a situation where anyone can gather enough support to kill it at that point. That being said, you're not wrong to be wary of that as stranger things have happened. All it means is the general populace needs to be involved in politics and not let that happen. This is good advice in general, even outside of UBI-related arguments.\n\n&gt; on his actual policy page he is saying that people on welfare or Medicaid or social security etc will have their current benefits weighed against the 1k\/month and have those benefits subtract from the UBI payment or you have to get off of them.\n\nSo in other words, they can choose to keep what they have, or switch over to UBI.

    "text":"&gt;but it is pragmatic.\n\nThere are several things that you're not considering and I believe that it's partly due to an idealistic view of the situation and the solution.\n\n&gt;Sure, minimal taxation is the ideal, but with our current welfare state, this isn\u2019t going to happen.\n\nWhich is why we need to not be advocating for a welfare state.\n\n&gt;We don\u2019t need to live with our head in the clouds to be a libertarian.\n\nAnd this is part of the problem, you think that people who are against Ubi are idealistic, that's not the case, it's the other way around. I'm not here to promote libertarianism as a ideal that we strive for, I'm here to promote it as a functional system.\n\n&gt;UBI reduces the size of necessary government\n\nNo it doesn't, first of all you will never convince any person within government to promote something like this and at the same time take out other government systems. Ubi is meant to be a supplemental income to cover the bases in which other forms of welfare might miss, not a catch-all solution to the problem.\n\n&gt;and gives more people the economic freedom to decide where their money is spent\n\nThis is why I don't call you a Libertarian, there's no such thing as economic freedom. To imply that people have an entitlement to resources undermines the very idea of what libertarianism is. It undermines the basic structure and throws it to the wind, you cannot support this and support natural rights. If you don't support natural rights then you basically throw out everything that is libertarian. And I'm not here, as I said before, to promote this as some idealism of libertarianism. Natural rights as a system of government enforcement is much more practical than what you're suggesting. You can't have it both ways, and that's why I'm saying this solution is bad.\n\nPart of the issue here is that I feel as though you don't understand what you're asking for, it's sort of like people who haven't really looked at the structures being fed this ideal version of them would promote them without really understanding The Logical consequences of it. The law is not something to be played with, we have to be very careful how we Implement laws and arguments into the system. Any arguments that we promote now we have to support later. And if the argument is that people deserve resources because that makes them free, you will eventually have to justify that within the rest of the system. Thus eliminating natural rights as a consequence. The two are irreconcilable oh, you can't believe that people have a right to other people's Resorts has without also saying that the other people that you are taking resources from don't have a right to their resources. And promoting this idea as though it were a practical solution is a huge problem because what it entails is the elimination of the very thing we're supposed to be fighting for.\n\n&gt;as opposed to all the current government handouts that are earmarked for specific expenses (section 8, food stamps, utility assistance - each along with its own bureaucracy). \n\nThe other problem with this is that it misunderstands the fundamental problem of these systems. The reason why these systems don't work isn't the fact that the systems are wrong, it's that the underlying logic is wrong. If you put forward an idea that does not match reality it will not function correctly. By introducing Ubi you do not solve the problem, you actually ignore a fundamental issue that we have yet to come up with a proper solution for. With technology becoming more and more advanced we are finding that people are less and less relevant to society, this isn't just a problem of poverty though this is a problem of psychology. You might think that if you just provide people with income you might solve this problem, this is the line of reasoning of socialists, which is why I don't view you as a Libertarian. And the reason why that never works is because the idea that it's based on, the fundamental presuppositions and arguments in favor of these things are wrong, when you implement these things you have to be able to justify them within reality or else when you implement them they don't function correctly. And that's because you could imagine that if you design a machine and it doesn't reflect what is physically possible to make in the world you can't actually make it. And instead if you do make something that kind of resembles it it isn't going to function because what you had designed is not the same as what you're putting into reality.\n\nThe last problem I want to bring up is the actual problem that you're trying to solve, which is poverty in a world where human beings are less and less relevant. I don't have a solution for you, it's too complicated of a problem and nobody knows how to fix it because not only are we not actually experiencing the problem yet, and trust me you think this is all bad just wait another 20 to 50 years, it's going to get a lot worse. We haven't really put our minds to the issue, and I can't see a solution to the problem right now, but I know that this isn't going to solve anything in fact it's going to make things worse. If we promote this as a solution it's not going to solve the underlying psychological issues of the citizens not having purposes in life and just living off of the state. Now you might want to deny this and say well people don't actually need work, they don't actually need a purpose within Society they can just ignore it. That's a problem of your personality reflecting the solution that you see, and that's the issue is that your personality isn't the same as every other person in society. One of the things that I've done is tried to study psychology because I believe that this is a real problem, and one of the things that I found through my studies is that personality is a huge factor in issues like this. People differ on conscientiousness so vastly, and openness as well, that what would sustain one person is completely different from what would sustain another person. People who are high in openness and low in conscientiousness are going to come up with Solutions like this, they're going to say well if we just have the resources to do whatever the hell we want then things will be fine. And I can see the benefits of that because if everybody was like that then yes this solution that you're coming up with would work, but not everybody is like that, in fact the vast majority of people are not like that. It's a very small minority in which this solution would actually work. And even then I don't even think it's a good solution for the people who have high openness, low conscientiousness, even if you are very low in conscientiousness you still need a purpose in life, will lead to depression if you don't give yourself things that you strive for. And the problem is that if there is no benefit to you doing anything within society given this post human labor market you're going to develop things like chronic pain, depression, addictions, a number of different issues will come about because of it.\n\nAlthough I haven't spent as much time as I'd like to on this problem, it's always been one in the back of my mind, and through my studies and University I found a lot of frightening things about people and where we're going with this whole technological Revolution. This isn't the same as the previous ones, we're not just going to find new jobs, we're not just going to fix it with you bi or some other similar welfare program, we're heading for a Judge Dread style dystopia where nobody really works everybody's really depressed and drug-addicted and we don't know what to do with our lives. And what that's going to end up doing is leading to a revolution, and I don't know who's going to be at the top of that but they're not going to be very nice people.\n\nI know this is a long post, it's a very complicated issue and I wish I could do it better Justice, but I can't cuz this isn't a paper, this is a comment on Reddit. And I want you to understand that there are several issues about this solution that you are trying to implement that you haven't considered. Many times we will run into problems and think there's a really simple solution that if we just did this thing everything will go away, but the problem is that reality is way too complicated, and solutions that you try to implement that involve society as a whole will not only often not solve the problem that you're trying to solve, you won't even know what it does. This is something that any social scientist should understand from the get-go, anything you try to do on a mass scale just doesn't work. You can't Puppeteer Society, it's not something that you have the ability to do. You will Overlook things you will not consider other issues you will view things from a singular dimension. Imagine a one-dimensional ant being on a four dimensional cube the size of the planet do you think that ant is going to be able to do anything productive with that Cube? Not really, it's too vast, it's changing constantly, its it's a completely different monster, a three-dimensional Cube would be just as difficult, it would be nearly impossible and that's without it changing all the time. But the surface changes, things move, and the Beast that you're trying to Wrangle with is more likely to eat you than it is to bow in submissiveness towards you. Its  too complicated, we're human beings, not Gods, we can do really amazing things with really simple things but when we're talking about humanity is a whole it's just too complicated for us and we need to implement very very specific solutions to very very specific problems rather than trying to implement Broad and sweeping solutions to these vast problems that we don't even know how to comprehend at the moment.",

It is not a replacement for appropriate health-related spending, as talked about above (Some people need significantly more support, some less, and countries can still provide that *and* produce better outcomes for everyone.  How?  Because universal healthcare systems do things like [pool risk](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Risk_pool), negotiate prices against monopolist drug companies (monopolist through pharmaceutical IP law) and locally monopolistic hospitals, etc., the kinds of things which result in huge increases in efficiency of the human workforce, who are healthier and freed up to actually be productive instead of having to do things like: negotiate as individuals with effectively no [bargaining power](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bargaining_power) for their lives against these monopolists the moment a person develops a healthcare issue).  \n\n&gt; I find it immoral to suddenly take those who are unable to care for themselves and expect them to interact with the economy in the same nature.  \n\nI agree.  Not only is it immoral (if that weren't enough), setting up a system that does this turns out to be *less efficient* for everyone involved.  Fundamentally putative, benefit-*denying* welfare systems turn out to hurt *everyone* in the end, because they produce less efficient workforces (which you can see *for both healthcare AND income support programs* in, for example, the Scandinavian social safety nets).  \n\n^ The same argument can be used to defend a UBI, and a UBI that doesn't replace the kinds of costs UBI *isn't designed to address*.  \n\n------\n\n&gt; Are there any instances where UBI studies have dealt with this question?\n\nUnfortunately, no.

Unfortunately, a lot of these locations don't have adequate (or any) healthcare welfare in place (or even adequate or any private healthcare services, at all), so the UBI pilots don't involve taking that money.  \n\nPractically all of the ones that took place in developed countries were funded from outside sources anyway, so, again, that's a reason why local health expenditure was not going to be directed towards the UBI.  \n\n---------\n\nThere are some results that may be of interest to you, even if they do not have to do with answering the question of \"Does replacing healthcare spending with a UBI ruin a UBI's effectiveness for the most vulnerable?\"  \n\nBoth of these examples, to be clear, do not involve replacing healthcare expenditure with a UBI, and are not relevant to that question.  \n\nBut I would like to present two examples showing that a UBI funded independently has some positive effect on health outcomes.   \n\nThe first is the Uttar Pradesh\/UNICEF\/SEWA income experiments, which found that spending on medicine spontaneously increased. Another potentially interesting result of this experiment was that some of the most vulnerable members of the community (the disabled and elderly) reported almost a *change in culture*, wherein they described a sense of being respected, included, and as \"having value\" in a way that wasn't happening before.  \n\nThe second would be the Manitoba, Canada Mincome experiments, analyzed by economist Dr. Evelyn Forget.  One of the unexpected things Forget found resulting from this very modest income program was a small decrease in hospital visits coinciding with the period of the program.  \n\nSo UBI does have a minor positive effect on healthcare outcomes alone, but the nature of health problems \n\n(high unequal: here in the US we have ~50% of the population spends almost nothing, and the 'top' 5% of the population spends 50% of the total) \n\nmeans that a \"flat rate\" UBI given to all would *not* be an appropriate tool for addressing health issues.  The structure of UBI isn't designed for that problem and imho shouldn't be used for it.  It should be used only for more universal income support needs.  ",

It merely leads us towards some *general* political and economic positions so long as those positions rest within the moral frame work.\n\nWe *tend* to be free market socialists because free market socialism is a best representation of a mutually beneficial relationship based on the Golden Rule. One can be completely communist and a mutualist if that ethical philosophy leads them to conclude that communism is the best method to attain a higher moral standard between affected parties; they're rare but they exist. \n\nThis is why we are inevitably completely anti-State *and* anti-Capitalism because there's nothing mutually beneficial about hierarchal top-down relationships. Recognizing a rare \"silver lining\" is not nearly good enough to justify the inequality (social and economic) that the State and Capitalism create, not to mention the inevitable injustice and oppression inherent with both concepts.\n\n----\n\n* 1\n\n&gt;When you mentioned the renting of public land and individuals paying the public in return for the \"ownership\" of land, what would be the representation\/manifestation of the public in the absence of a state? \n\nThis would be most likely taken care of by the trade union that develops the properties. It could be a variety of unions depending on the nature of the property. Quite frankly, the more splintered the various trade unions the better (and by splintered I do not mean opposing).\n\nThey would be able to hold public auctions for leases over various properties. A natural equilibrium would be found in time between the cost of the lease as well as the time frame; thus the beauty of markets. Private developers would be influenced to develop their respective properties to match their own demands as well as be able to hold onto subsequent leases.\n\nI feel that a \"first come first served\" policy should be in place that allows existing owners first dibs to renew the lease before it is put up for public bid. It just makes sense. Kind of like how sports stars are able to renegotiate longer contracts when they get toward the end of their existing contract before they opt to go into free agency. It does put a little interest on maintaining properties.\n\n&gt;Say I wanted to temporarily rent a field for whatever reason, who would I get in contact with and who would I pay?\n\nDepending on the nature of the property, the respective union that operates that kind of property.

It could be anything from meeting with the respective union at their union hall to holding massive public bids once a month\/quarter\/year. Make a spectacle out of it, make a \"state fair\" so to speak.\n\nWhatever works best for that community. \n\n----\n\n* 2\n\n&gt;What would be used as payment? What would the currency be?\n\nI personally really like the way crypto-currencies are being developed. I'm not a fan of BitCoin in specific mostly because of its ties to the AnCap\/Right-Lib movement as an investment. But as more crypto-currencies are developed, the more competition over those currencies create a natural equilibrium. \n\nBut currency can be anything.\n\n---\n\n* 3\n\n&gt; How would a UBI be managed in the absence of a state?\n\nAgain, managed via that Syndicate\/Syndicalist process. \n\n&gt;How would people be paid and who would do the necessary administrative work?\n\nFrom those public funds raised through the public leases on public lands. You have to remember that the GeoLib\/Georgist approach to land allocation provides a substantial \"taxation\" process... It's merely entirely voluntary and can be completely avoided if desired. It also means that the more people gather up \"private\" properties, the more money is available to everyone else.\n\nIt's quite different knowing that rich asshole up on the hill has that super nice house. It's another thing knowing that that rich asshole up on the hill is paying *you* for the right to that nice house. \n\n----\n\n* **Did this help?**",

Suppose you work full time (2,087 hours per year):\n\nMonthly earnings without Freedom Dividend ($16.50\/hr): $2,867.86\n\nMonthly earnings without Freedom Dividend (minimum wage of $7.25\/hr): $1,260.12\n\nMonthly earnings without Freedom Dividend (unemployed): $0\n\nMonthly earnings with Freedom Dividend ($16.50\/hr): $3,867.86\n\nMonthly earnings with Freedom Dividend (minimum wage of $7.25\/hr): $2,160.12\n\nMonthly earnings with Freedom Dividend (unemployed): $1,000\n\nWithout the freedom dividend, you earn 228% of what a minimum wage worker earns, and unemployed people have literally zero buying power whatsoever.

There have been socialist movements in nearly every country on Earth\n&gt;\n&gt;Nationalism is also extremely popular around the globe, with nationalist movements existing for every country. Does this mean everyone wants to live in repressive authoritarian ethnostates? No. Similarly not everyone who is left wants to live in a commune, I think the idea of having a house which your family lives in and a plot of land to yourself is something universally appealing to everyone who isn't a crusty looking hippy.\n\nMy point was \"not everybody wants to live in a commune\" is not a good argument when just as many people don't want to live in capitalism either. If it's wrong to make people who don't want to live in communes, how is it not wrong to force people to live in capitalism? And the record totally proves that capitalists have way more violently oppressed communists than communists have ever even come close to. Even mainstream liberal opinions mean you get violently repressed within capitalism. If you want to see how violently Capitalism has treated leftists, just look at Che Guevara, Thomas Sankara, MLK, Malcolm X, Frank Hampton, the Move bombing in Philadelphia, Salvador Allende, the current coup in Venezuela in the name of 'democracy', and many other examples.\n\nAs long as we continue to live in class society, capitalists will continue to violently destroy anything that gets in the way of profits. Even democratically elected socialists like Allende are killed and replaced with dictators time and time again, showing capitalists have no respect for the self determination of those who wish to live without it. In fact it is the natural tendency of capitalism to imperialize, and capitalists must come to control other nations in order to expand markets and better exploit cheap labor. Without that exploitation of the third world, and without expanding markets, economic growth ceases to become possible as we cease to create new demand for labor, people lose their income and stop consuming, and we fall into economic depression *precisely because* we have run out of artificial ways to force people to work to earn their right to survive.\n\nEven if you implement UBI it will be the natural tendency of capitalists to, by any means necessary, raise prices or otherwise make you spend more of your income on their product, and once again you will no longer be able to afford to survive without working and the economy will fall into depression. Even if you legislate against this, capitalists will use extra-legal means to change the rules such that you give as many of your resources to them as possible. Any type of social democracy that exists today is temporary against the natural tendency and inherent need of Capitalism to increase demand and profit, profit by definition being value created by the working class and appropriating the rich. Capitalism is impossible to reform because it is defined specifically by private individuals stealing from pools of socially produced resources.

They do not have the money or power to threaten us but they do have nuclear weapons and repeatedly attacking them is a good way to cause a disaster. Up until this story their primary response has been to return our astronauts home safely. There is no Russiagate.\n\nIf  you are familiar with the basic history of the region it is the US who has been destabilizing it for quite some time. The war on terror started to catch Bin Laden, formerly our asset we trained to use terrorism against the Soviets in Afghanistan. \n\nBenghazi was dumb, I'm not sure why you brought it up. That said, if you know anything about corruption you should check out the Clinton Foundation.\n\nLet's also not forget the timeline.\n\nHillary lost. First she blamed Comey and the FBI for not exonerating her on email server misuse. Then it was Bernie's fault. Then, amazingly, it was Russia's fault and James Comey and the FBI would prove it. That's odd.\n\nThe Mueller Report found some questionable things and proved some of Trump's staff are liars or can't remember things. That's it. The Russians in part two took Mueller to court and made him backtrack.\n\n While I'm sure Russia has some programs aimed at propaganda as do all other world powers the idea Russia is suddenly a huge player in our everyday politics is absurd.\n\nLet's consider if that is the case for the sake of argument. So Russia was able to infiltrate our communications and control our elections. This all would have had to have happened under Obama and Biden. Now the same people who say this is what happened are telling you only Biden can stop it. Does this make any sense whatsoever to you?\n\nTrump won because politicians in both parties have failed to meet he needs of the people because their job is to meet the needs of their donors. We had tea party and occupy. Republicans tried to harness this movement but Trump took it out of their hands. Democrats simply ignored the fact Obama failed to transform the country and wound up being more similar to Bush Jr. than anyone expected.\n\nFor Trump's entire presidency the left has been ignored by Democrats in favor of ceaselessly talking about Trump and Russia. All that time you had Yang with UBI, Bernie with M4A, as well as other good ideas that benefit people but are bad for the short term profits of industries involved. Then we get covid where those ideas would have been incredibly helpful but again the story is about Trump and not the 5 trillion of our tax dollars being transferred to the wealthiest when regular people are getting laid off, evicted, and fucking dying.\n\nTalking about Russia is a distraction from the fact Democrats are offering nothing. We already know Republicans are batshit, they elected Trump. That doesn't mean we should lower our standards or start believing garbage, especially if that garbage could start a nuclear war.",

In fact, Yang has gone on the record as saying the long term goal should be to replace income taxes with VATs.\n\nOkay, so the taxes raise $1.3 trillion towards the $2.8 trillion cost of the program, that leaves $1.5 trillion. UBI doesn't stack on top of welfare programs like food stamps, TANF, and SSI. That'll reduce the cost of those programs by $500-600 million.\n\nMost poor people will go out and spend most or all of their $1k\/month, which creates a multiplier effect throughout the economy. More jobs are created, growth accelerates, and tax revenues grow accordingly. The Roosevelt Institute projects $800-900 million will be generated. We are left with $200 billion to $0 to account for.\n\nLastly, we have cost savings. It is expensive to have poor people, so giving them $1k\/month saves $100-200 billion on healthcare, incarceration, and homelessness services.\n\nIf we take the lowest revenue projections, that leaves us short $100 billion. Using the highest revenue projections results in a $200 billion surplus. So you can imagine some years revenues might be on the low end, sometimes on the high end. Overall, the net result is as close to balanced as any program this size can be.",

It is a system that is constantly in motion, driven by both the class stuggle and technological advancement, at both the national and international level.\n\nLet's say that the workers movement though massive mobilisation to the polls force through UBI financed by taxes on the rich and on companies. If it is a UBI big enough to actually provide a worthy life then the capitalists will move their capital away from the country, collapsing the national economy and with it the system of UBI. When UBI is gone capital will invest again and we are back where we started. If the UBI is small, just enough to scrape by, then workers would still be desperate and take almost any job they can get. The capitalists will use its on power and money to push the UBI down more, spending millions on propaganda and bribes. Just look at what has happend to the nordic welfare states. They are crumbling in part because of the global market, but mainly because the decades of social democratic politics have deradicalised and disarmed the working class, and so in turn even the social democrats.

If everyone pursues their own interests that seems nice in theory until you realize that self interests contradict with one another and sometimes people gain at the expense of other people.\n\nUtilitarianism, trying to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, essentially attempts to measure everyone's self interest and reach the most optimal conclusions for all parties involved. \n\nIt should be noted Im not a pure utilitarian, I actually do implement some elements of other ideas such as rights into my view, mainly because I beleive these have inherent utilitarian outcomes in some ways. It might make sense, from an act utilitarian standpoint, to kill one to please 10 others, but it might be better still to have a right to life, which overrides these individual cases and establishes extra parameters that help achieve even greater long term outcomes, because a society in which we dont send people to their deaths for the sake of others may be better than ones that we do all the time. If that makes sense. So Im not even a pure utilitarian even. Just primarily utilitarian that borrows from other views sometimes to improve the concept beyond its natural shortcomings.\n\n&gt;It just feels wrong to me to see other people suffer. I do not enjoy to live off of other people's misery. But I know these feelings are partly instinctual and that morality is a construct of society and perhaps evolution. Good and Evil do not exist in the universe, only in our minds.\n\nDo you enjoy suffering? No? Then try to avoid causing others to suffer. Pretty straightforward to me. There are preferences in humanity that are nearly universal, not suffering is one of them. So suffering should be minimized.\n\n&gt;Murder feels wrong to me. But I cannot logically tell you why it is wrong other than it is destructive to society.\n\nbecause humans have developed strong survival instincts and a preference for life. Morality and government are rules established to better improve our lives in line with our natural evolved proclivities. Murder is essentially counter to the purpose of morality and pretty much undermines the purpose of it in the first place. We could live in a world in which we kill each other, but most of us would not find that preferable. \n\nAlso, religious arguments arent that strong. Ever hear of the euthyphro dilemma? Is murder bad because god says so? or is it bad because of other reasons? What if god said murder was good? Would you be okay with killing others? I'd imagine you would still have problems with the concept. Which kind of defeats the purpose of god. Some dude saying \"because I said so\" isnt a good argument that appeals to more evolved moral psyches. Morality, in order to not be arbitrary, must be based on something based in the real world. Not mere \"authority.\" Which brings us back to your question. And I think I already posed an adequate answer.\n\n&gt; people have always had to work to survive.\n\nWhich is a bit of an argument from nature. We've spent most of our history dying from inadequate medical treatment too, due to medicine being a modern thing. Just because something is natural doesn't make it good or right. if anything, if you really take what I said above and its implications seriously....morality and governance is essentially unnatural. It's taking the state of nature and saying \"screw this, we can do better.\" So simply saying people have always had to work isn't a good argument for the virtues of work. \n\n&gt;Our existence on the planet coerces us to work for our own survival. \n\nYes, but capitalism kind of turns those urges against us in a systemic kind of way to avoid responsibility for its actions. Capitalism also establishes a system of property rights that are unjust to many from a certain perspective. And while im not totally against the concept of property like some on the far left, these shortcomings should be taken into account, and compensated for.\n\n&gt;While there may a come day when people no longer have to work, I think it's obvious that technology has not reached that point.\n\nWe are quickly reaching that point. A lot of my views on economics were also forged during the recession. During the obama years. I got rid of my immature right wing views, and between college education in the social sciences, and applying that stuff to my life and what we're doing as a whole....our system is messed up.\n\nWe predicate our society on the belief that everyone must work and earn their own right to exist more or less....but our system doesnt guarantee work. We have a system where many can be out of work...while the rich make record profits, and what do we do? Insist on \"job creation\" to create more work for people to do....we are literally trying to create work to satisfy a paradigm predicated on the idea that everyone must work. But work for everyone not only is irrational to me, it's a fool's errand. our society can't function without an excess labor force. We would get stagflation. And this excess labor force also leads to a lot of the exploitation under capitalism, because it drives down wages and worker's rights. Combine this with the rise of global capitalism in which elites can destroy jobs in places that demand high standards for them and create them in third world crapholes for pennies on the dollar and you got a system in which work simply cannot and will not guarantee everyone a decent existence.\n\nCombine this with automation. A lot of jobs will reach the point in coming decades where automation could destroy tons of jobs. We're working on self driving cars. That will put a lot of people out of work, truck drivers, for example. A lot of fast food work will be automated, possibly retail. There have been studies saying we could see like half our jobs disappear in 20 years before. \n\nhttp:\/\/nerdist.com\/report-finds-47-of-u-s-jobs-at-high-risk-of-being-automated-in-10-20-years\/\n\nAnd what's our answer? Oh, well we will create more jobs. We value work for its own sake, not because of it being necessary. And I dont believe we will ever be totally free of work. But I do think we could get rid of a lot of grunt work and involuntary work. We could make it more voluntary, having people on UBI get a minimum and people who wanna work make more. I think that's a fair compromise. people still have freedom to do what they want, they actually have more freedom due to not being coerced into crappy jobs.\n\nBasic income isnt fully automated luxury gay space communism. It's compatible with capitalism. It makes life easier, but also is compatible with a paradigm in which many people still choose to work. It simply offers a floor and is compatible with our current system today.\n\n&gt;Given that basic income, realistically, will not happen any time soon, do you have any ambition to work? \n\nPositive ambition? No. Does coercion work? Yes. But a life in which I have no positive ambition and I'm coerced is essentially the life of a slave. Which is why I have the views I do.\n\nShould be worth noting here I may also have aspergers, not diagnosed but highly suspected, and that may impact my motivation too. \n\n&gt;Would you work in a job if you thought you were fairly compensated for your labor?\n\nIf I believe the tradeoffs were worth it, sure. But I can't really see that happening without UBI. Because work without UBI is inherently coercive since I can't realistically say no...and the employer knows that. So I work on his terms, not my own. \n\nNow, if I could negotiate with a boss to set my hours up a certain way, and not have to work overtime, and have so many days off, and actually be able to exert my own bargaining position through refusal to work if he refuses my terms, that would make the concept much more palatable. But again, work as it exists is akin to slavery to me. Workers dont have that freedom, they dont have the autonomy. They listen to what the boss man says, or they screw off and starve. \n\n&gt;LIs there a certain job you could see yourself doing?\n\nWhen I was a christian, I wanted to do something in politics ironically, which is why I have such a passion for the subject. I beleived it was my \"calling\". Now, I realize jobs in politics are difficult to get, my views of right and wrong no longer fit in the mainstream, I have personality quirks that make me brutally honest and unwilling to compromise with what I see as a corrupt political establishment, and I don't believe I'm a good fit. So Im screwed.\n\nI think if I could do it all over without any of this religion BS clouding my mind I would've done something with computers. \n\n&gt;Or is it the nature of work that you oppose\n\nIm very much against the nature of work. But I recognize many people value the system as it is so basic income + capitalism is a good compromise I think. It gives everyone what they want IMO. Except maybe the elites who pay more taxes and have a work force that is less responsive to their every whims because they actually have a right to refuse them. ",

Or that, in 1968, the year of his assassination, King had planned a [Poor People's March on Washington](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poor_People%27s_Campaign) in support of economic justice for all. The broader economic aspect of the civil rights movement, and the ideas of class and racial solidarity that accompanied it, has been largely omitted in popular teachings and culture.\n\nOne of the key demands at the March on Washington was a $2\/hr minimum wage, which would be [~$18\/hr when adjusted for inflation](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/dowv4x97ep981.png). Instead, our federal minimum wage is $7.25\/hr. National inflation adjustment isn't perfect, as different locales have experienced different cost increases, and many necessity costs, such as healthcare and housing, have outpaced inflation, however it does speak volumes that even a somewhat conservative adjustment of the $2\/hr minimum wage would be $18\/hr today.\n\nYesterday politicians that vehemently oppose a $15\/hr minimum wage (and other forms of economic justice) posted tributes to MLK, claiming to support him, when they likely would have vilified him if they were around in the 60s and they definitely do not represent a modern version of King's anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist views.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nI highly recommend reading \"A Freedom Budget for All Americans\", which was an economic plan constructed by economists and activists in the mid-late 60s.\n\n&gt; In the fall of 1965, after the Voting Rights Act passed, the coalition of black, socialist, and progressive leaders who had come together to organize 1963\u2019s March on Washington joined together again to create an ambitious policy document with no less a goal than ending poverty in the United States without cost to taxpayers. First released in 1966, it proposed using strong economic growth to provide a federal jobs guarantee, universal health care, and a basic income. This executive summary of the full report, published in 1967, was endorsed by more than 100 signatories and was distributed in black neighborhoods. \n\nHere is the introduction from A. Philip Randolph, one of the key figures in the Freedom Budget:\n\n&gt; INTRODUCTION\n\n&gt; I believe, and profoundly hope, that from this day forth the opponents of social progress can take comfort no longer, for not since the March on Washington has there been such broad sponsorship and enthusiastic support for any undertaking as has been mobilized on behalf of \u201cThe Freedom Budget for All Americans.\u201d\n\n&gt; These forces have not come together to demand help for the Negro. Rather, we meet on a common ground of determination that in this, the richest and most productive society ever known to man, the scourge of poverty can and must be abolished\u2014not in some distant future, not in this generation, but within the next ten years!\n\n&gt; The tragedy is that the workings of our economy so often pit the white poor and the black poor against each other at the bottom of society. The tragedy is that groups only one generation removed from poverty themselves, haunted by the memory of scarcity and fearful of slipping back, step on the fingers of those struggling up the ladder.\n\n&gt; And the tragedy is that not only the poor, the nearly poor, and the once poor, but all Americans, are the victims of our failure as a nation to distribute democratically the fruits of our abundance. For, directly or indirectly, not one of us is untouched by the steady spread of slums, the decay of our cities, the segregation and overcrowding of our public schools, the shocking deterioration of our hospitals, the violence and chaos in our streets, the idleness of able-bodied men deprived of work, and the anguished demoralization of our youth.\n\n&gt; For better or worse, we are one nation and one people. We shall solve our problems together or together we shall enter a new era of social disorder and disintegration.\n\n&gt; What we need is an overall plan of attack.\n\n&gt; This is what the \u201cFreedom Budget\u201d is. It is not visionary or utopian. It is feasible. It is concrete. It is specific. It is quantitative. It talks dollars and cents. It sets goals and priorities. It tells how these can be achieved. And it places the responsibility for leadership with the Federal Government, which alone has the resources equal to the task.\n\n&gt; The \u201cFreedom Budget\u201d is not a call for a handout. It is a challenge to the best traditions and possibilities of America. It is a call to those who have grown weary of slogans and gestures to rededicate themselves to the cause of social reconstruction. It is a plea to men of good will to give tangible substance to long-proclaimed ideals.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2018\/02\/a-freedom-budget-for-all-americans-annotated\/557024\/\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Freedom_Budget_for_All_Americans\n\nFor a more radical look at King's work, check out the book The Radical King, which is a collection of King's writings edited by Cornel West:\n\n&gt; \u201cThe radical King was a democratic socialist who sided with poor and working people in the class struggle taking place in capitalist societies. . . . The response of the radical King to our catastrophic moment can be put in one word: revolution\u2014a revolution in our priorities, a reevaluation of our values, a reinvigoration of our public life, and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens. . . . Could it be that we know so little of the radical King because such courage defies our market-driven world?\u201d \u2014Cornel West, from the Introduction\n\n&gt; Every year, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is celebrated as one of the greatest orators in US history, an ambassador for nonviolence who became perhaps the most recognizable leader of the civil rights movement. But after more than forty years, few people appreciate how truly radical he was.\n\n&gt; Arranged thematically in four parts, The Radical King includes twenty-three selections, curated and introduced by Dr. Cornel West, that illustrate King\u2019s revolutionary vision, underscoring his identification with the poor, his unapologetic opposition to the Vietnam War, and his crusade against global imperialism. As West writes, \u201cAlthough much of America did not know the radical King\u2014and too few know today\u2014the FBI and US government did. They called him \u2018the most dangerous man in America.\u2019 . . . This book unearths a radical King that we can no longer sanitize.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/239755\/the-radical-king-by-martin-luther-king-jr-cornel-west\/",

That's what's going on in the world right now, and especially in America.\n\nNot really. Jobs have been going in and out of existence for all of human history. When cars were invented everyone who had a horse-and-buggy job eventually lost that job. Did that ruin the economy? Did those people just drop dead? No.\n\nIt's *possible* that in a future with literally no use for jobs we might need to change our system. But currently this is simply not the case. Every new automation system just upscales the economy. In other words, if you can replace 10 workers with a single worker, you don't just fire nine...you make your business 10x larger and more efficient so now you can employ *even more people*. We see this over and over in the economy.\n\n&gt;Trump diagnosed the problem correctly but didn't solve it. People are losing their jobs. He thought it was because of immigrants. He said he would create jobs. He failed.\n\nThis is all the opposite of true. The number of actual jobs available has been increasing and the unemployment rate has been decreasing ([source](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/)). We're having *record* unemployment rates, especially for minority groups.\n\nNow, I'm not naive enough to pretend this is purely due to Trump's policy. And I agree job loss is not due to immigrants (illegal immigration is a problem for reasons other than occupational ones). But I can find *no* evidence whatsoever that we've been losing jobs in the economy. Even left-wing publications are not bold enough to blatantly lie about it.\n\n&gt;Andrew Yang came up with a wonderful solution: 1000$\/month to every American.\n\nI like Yang. I even think UBI is a good idea that won't work. It won't work not because of the principle involved but because of the reality of politics. Any entitlement you grant, whether it is UBI, social security, Medicare, welfare, etc. becomes a permanent fixture of the government and, more importantly, a tool for politicians to gain votes.\n\nIn other words, UBI relies on **disciplined** and careful use. The benefits are largely built into the simplicity, generality, and limitations inherent in the plan. Yang understands these implementation mechanisms. But the *second* it's actually implemented the next Democratic politician will just say \"Yang only gave you $1,000 a month. I'm offering $2,000 a month!\" And the next Republican politician will then say \"They are bankrupting the country with $2,000 a month. I'm going to limit UBI only to people making under $60k per year!\"\n\nAnd then you end up with welfare again. The benefits of UBI are gone because nobody really understood why it was a good idea in the first place (nor why welfare tends to be a *bad* idea).\n\nIn fact, it's exactly like Social Security; the original idea was to have a government-guaranteed 401k for all Americans. You paid in part of your check during your work, the government invested the pool of money, and you were paid back with interest when you retired. It's actually a good idea (and why 401k's and IRA's are fantastic investments).\n\nBut politicians got involved and now Social Security is paid out to people who haven't paid in. It's also paying out far more than the interest value of those who *did* pay in. And the pool of taxes being put into it is being used for other programs. Social Security is no longer a 401k...it's a ponzi scheme. And each new generation has to pay to support the old.\n\nIf UBI were implemented, do you think they'd actually *replace* welfare with it? Or Social Security? Or Medicare? Yeah, right. It would just be another taxation and redistribution system with all the inherent problems of our current ones.\n\nIn principle I support UBI.

    "text":"Hey, he did not say he would not support Bernie, he just said he did not agree with the policy of rent control. I live in CA, close to SF, which has a very tight regulation and rent control, and it does not work because many people are homeless. We need more housings, not more tight control.  Not all landlords are bad and their goals are to invest their money. Rent control make many landlords losing money in SF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree examples. A real estate agent told me his mom lived in SF for over 40 years, and her rent is still  $185 a month, that is due to rent control. In SF, most of one bedroom apartment cost over $2000 per month. The landlord can not raise the rent or move his mom out, I do not know why, but $185 40 years ago is very different from $200 now. So the landlord is losing money each month. It is not fair. A fair business should be win win for both parties, not one sided.\n\nThe second case was one Chinese lady subdivided her house to host many veterans at much below market value, veterans like it because the rent is low, but SF government does not like it because it violated its rule of square foot per person. The veterans were forced to move out to become homeless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third one is a Chinese woman again(Chinese people like to invest in real estate) rented out her apartments to four tenant families. They later found out that one of the unit was built without the permit. What the four tenant families do? They stopped paying rent for over a year, and at the same time suing the landlord for $20 millions for whatever bullish damage. Their claim was they might be physically harmed due to house was built without inspection. I gave this example just to show that not all tenants are wonderful. So always siding with \"poor working families\" against a business might not be reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing for sure for me is that I would never invest in real estate in SF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalifornia is known to have many tedious laws and rules. Right now every public building I entered will have a phrase outside saying that the building might have some substances cause cancer. What do I do? Dig a hole in my own soil?  but then the soil is contaminant as well. I buy tea bags from a CA tea company, the warning says the same thing.   The result: I just ignore warnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo years ago Google planned to build about 4000 or 400 housing units and later the company gave up, why? Because the government fee per unit is about $240k, you can not build an affordable housing if one has to pay about $240k to the government alone per unit. Facebook decided to move into Mountain View, and the company had to agree that the company will not provide food to its employees, why? Because to stimulate local restaurants, but that is silly, because facebook will hire some people to work in their own buildings if it allow to open restaurants in its own building. I think governments are doing too much for no benefit, with obvious harms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat government need is to make a level field for all its citizens, rather than choosing one side over the other unless one side does not practice morally. Free higher education, medicare for all, break up big banks, increase tax for the rich and business UBI, etc, I support them all, but for rent control, these things do not work. What government can do is to encourage developers to build more units, once you have supply match up with demand, the rent will go down by itself. But what SF do is at the one hand, discourage developer to build more units by enforcing ridiculous tight rules, at the other hand, force rent control.  But if you have 2 millions family  with one million units of housing,you have housing crisis regardless you control rents or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalifornia is the 8th largest economical body in the world, and CA is the poorest in US if cost of living is adjusted. CA is also controlled by democratic parties. Obviously not all democratic policies are working.  CA spend huge amount of money on welfare and one thing I can say for sure is that it is heavily abused by so called low income families.  Many people hide or lie about their incomes. So a universal rule is much better than a special rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I am a Bernie supporter because who he is and his policies are universal, but I think it harmful if government is over-regulating its businesses.",

I am going to read Bernard Lietaer's book \"Rethinking Money\".\n\nI agree with what you wrote-- but again, MMT is being politicized by certain groups to make it sound like we can just print as much money as we want with no consequences.  People on Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube sincerely ask why we don't forgive student loans, make college free, pass the Green New Deal, implement UBI and\/or job guarantee?  Because adding more money (debt) to the system will blow up a bigger financial bubble that eventually will get popped (liquidity traps) or will compound into hyperinflation (another form of default).  Not sustainable because the real world has limits to growth.  Of course, politics and corruption\/ waste are part of the problem, but as you said, it's also a monetary problem.\n\nThere are rumors that future CBDC could have two tiers (local and international): negative interest rates for the local currency (similar concept to WIR) and positive interest rates for international trade (multi-currency system).  This will solve the deflationary trend (lower economic growth) while preventing currency wars.  I'm not thrilled about the loss of privacy and freedom that comes with CBDC, but it seems inevitable that a new monetary system will replace the petrodollar soon.\n\nRussia announced today it will sell its energy exports only for rubles to \"non-friendly\" countries-- which is just a step away from selling oil for gold.  Many European countries that rely upon Russian oil and gas do not have anything to trade for rubles-- interesting times.  There's a lot to unpack right now in current events-- potential energy and food shortages and economic collapse.\n\nAs for gold and bitcoin, both fluctuate in price (bitcoin especially) no different from the US dollar fluctuating on the forex market-- but in the long term over decades, the trend is clear: dollar down, gold up, and crypto varies based on future utility.  Looking at the charts, we are due for a deflationary period, but because of supply shocks, we might end up with 1970s stagflation.\n\nThere's a saying \"Fix the money, fix the world\".  The more I ponder collapse, the more I realize that the current financial system has messed up incentives and brings out the worst in human nature (greed, fear, power, exploitation).

Most of human history we existed as egalitarian tribes, where excessive pride was generally socially frowned upon, and individual freedom was supreme. Eventually we started to embrace religions that valued hierarchy, this lead to the concentration of wealth, and unequal access to resources and opportunities with in a community. That is when the divide between capital and labor started, around 200,000 years ago. And how 'civilized society' invented poverty, by creating 'scarcity' with hierarchy. That eventually lead to private property.\n\nPrivate property is not the problem, it has proven to be a very power productivity multiplier. Seizing the means of production, tends to lead to mismanagement of the tools of production, and reduce productive capacity. It's like taxing wealth instead of production, the wealthy end up selling the means of production to pay taxes, reducing the productivity of the business and employees. But taxing per unit production (aka 'VAT') or labor, are a function *of* production, raising taxes on one of those and it tends to directly raise the cost of products. Not as likely to directly destroy the means of production.\n\nThat is why UBI is the most likely social revolution. It keeps the productivity of private property, but ends the counter productive trauma of poverty, by establishing a minimum access to resources and opportunities. The success or failure of UBI will depend on its ability to purchase relevant and diverse means of production, while avoiding the traumas of poverty.

Can you imagine not having a computer now? The people in the 90's could and hell a lot of people in the 2000's could too! Try applying to job without a computer now. THAT is the exponential growth that has caused this sort of panic and saying that its the same as before is disingenuous, at best.\n\nI really don't understand this point, we've been having exponential growth for the last 50 years but now all of a sudden it's a problem? You could have said the same thing 20 years ago that oh this exponential growth is gonna result in massive unprecedented job loss soon but it hasn't. You say it's different now because suddenly everyone needs a computer but that's our reality now and the unemployment rate was low before covid. Clearly computers haven't caused unprecedented job loss yet and you can't know that it'll happen before exponential growth slows down.\n\n&gt;You're right but the unemployment  rate is not the best indicator of quality of life. The work has moved  elsewhere but I'd ask for you to think what happened to those  communities where those jobs reigned supreme. Those who could move out  and strike out for better jobs did but those that couldn't were left in a  place that was as destitute as them. The loss of manufacturing crippled  America both politically and economically, look at places like Detroit  who still haven't recovered from this. One of Trump's main points was a  (false) promise to bring back these jobs. Doesn't that say something  drastic about what the loss of these jobs led to?\n\nSure it sucks in places where the industry has dried up but that's not really anything new. Also the loss of manufacturing hasn't crippled America politically and economically the economy really hasn't been that bad before corona and I really don't think American politics are uniquely bad right now. \n\n&gt;*However*, ask any respected  economist about the affect of AI on the workplace in 10-20 years; I  guarantee you most  of their answers will range from worried uncertainty  to exactly what I've been saying.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to be worried, AI will absolutely have an impact on the workforce and that's something we need to keep in mind. I just don't think it's some unique problem now like you make it out to be.\n\n&gt;Tech startups don't need hundreds of people; places like Microsoft  doesn't need hundreds of employees at every office. We are becoming more  and more efficient as a society; we don't have the capacity(or need) to  keep creating more and more jobs like this.\n\nWe've been growing more efficient as a society for hundreds of years, every time we become more efficient the quality of life just goes up and demand for other jobs increases and the jobs get filled. It's not like now we're going to automate more stuff become more efficient and just maintain our current quality of life but just have less people working. \n\nI feel like one good point you made is that it's different from when we transition from farming to industry because we don't have low skilled jobs to replace the low skilled jobs. Which I think is a good point and that now there will be more short term suffering when people lose their low skilled jobs to automation\n\n&gt;I don't meant to say that this is some sort of Apocalypse. *If we are well prepared for this inevitable future then it will not be this bad.*  This is why I supported Yang and I ask that you look at his policies  (even if you disagree with them) because they reflect this future.\n\nYang's UBI seems very impractical IMO.",

So I know first hand how much work it takes for $250 worth of SNAP. \n\nThe majority of welfare recipients receive less than $1000 per adult living in the home. For the fringe cases, UBI is opt in, so if your benefits are more than $1000 per adult you can keep them and they will be adjusted for VAT so the overall value isnt diminished. \n\nIn summation, the vast majority of welfare recipients will greatly benefit from UBI both financially and mental health wise. While there are fringe cases that may not benefit, they will not be hurt. We also have to be cognizant about the fact that millions of dollars will be pumped into local communities revitalizing their economies and providing more opportunity for work. \n\nI think in our desire to make sure everyone is taken care of, we lose sight that in ideal America no one should need welfare benefits and we should strive to eliminate them because we have eliminated the need for them.",

I personally have a feeling though that automation is going to be a huge societal force that we need to start looking towards before it just completely eats up jobs. In an extreme matter, what do we want our society to look like in a world where 90% of available jobs are being done by machines? I don't know, maybe we won't get there, maybe we will. But at the rate we are moving now I feel like we need to support the folks who have lost their jobs in the short run for sure, but also need to start looking forward at the possibility that there may simply just not be that many jobs left in the future in general. Theoretically, if we have machines that can do any manufacturing job, any service job, then what's left? \n\nI will say that while in absolute terms about manufacturing production that it hasn't decreased, the jobs definitely have decreased, I think the main point I wanted to make about that is that a large part of the reason jobs are decreasing is due to technological advances, not just offshoring per se. I'm not quite sure what you mean by the 1% selling us out, but I think its more of the fact that in countries such as China there are simply less regulations and so they have much cheaper labor. That's part of the reason there's such a huge knockoff market in China, because of their lack of IP laws. In a global economy it's hard to fight off the movement of industry to places where it's cheaper, and that's part of the tradeoff in engaging in more efficient trade. That's where the argument for tariffs come in, the tradeoff there is that we can keep some jobs in the states, but at the price of much more expensive goods.\n\nRegarding the fact that we have plenty of bartenders with BA degrees, I was skeptical about that but to my surprise found an article from 2012 that said that about 12% of bartenders indeed have BA degrees, I'm sure the number has increased as well in the last 6 years. I feel like that is primarily due to a transition in higher education, where a 4 year degree is becoming more and more equivalent to what a high school degree used to be. On one hand its good because having a higher educated population, no matter what job they end up doing, has plenty of societal benefits (decreased crime rates, increased voter participation, etc.). On the other hand, these degrees are much much more expensive than high school diplomas in the US. \n\nSo where does that leave us? Do we continue to try and recuperate jobs that used to exist, do we provide easier access to bachelors degrees and let people work jobs they are overqualified for, do we begin to consider more dramatic solutions to the problem of automation such as a Universal Basic Income? I don't really know.\nI'm just an undergrad so I'm sure I have my fair share of biases, so please take what I say with a grain of salt. Maybe I'm wrong about all of this, but I think it's worth discussing. ",

When you are young you manage to find such dramatic things to base your behavior on\n\nI think the biggest problem with being child free is that there isn\u2019t really an infrastructure to maintain friendships with a bunch of other people who you know are going to live the same way you do, it can be hard to resist all the pressure when many people around you start getting married and having children, many people have kids just to maintain their relationship to their peers or to replace those relationships with someone who will never leave. A lot of the fulfill you get when you are young is just because of all the other people around you doing the same things, as they start to disappear so does that fulfillment. \n\nI know that personally when I hear relatives make claims that they aren\u2019t having kids it bothers me a little and I try to tell them not to define their future so much. It\u2019s very similar to teenagers who wanna tell you about Marxism\/communism, etc. We don\u2019t want to hear it, because we know that when people are young they are hyper politically, moral, and anything else they can look into that\u2019s not the status quo. It\u2019s normal to try to escape from reality and cope by convincing yourself that life will change within your lifetime so you don\u2019t need to climb the ladder the way you saw your parents. Like it\u2019s fine to think that as long as you are going to work hard enough that you could have them if you wanted, but more often people have these types of opinions so that they don\u2019t have to live up to normal expectations, people think that since kids are expensive and time consuming that by not having them they can avoid a lot of things in life that IMO generally isn\u2019t true, you can\u2019t maintain your life from your early 20s even if you avoid all responsibility. I wish it was possible, but your youth will always be fleeting, so you might as well do something that makes it feel like it was your own decision, rather than letting life pass you by.\n\nI think the thing that often changes peoples mind is when they slowly realize that they have become their parents, but without children. Your identity dried up, no one cares about you, you are working full time, you no longer relate to your peers and feel awkward being the old guy amongst younger people who you have more in common with.\n\nI think young people get too wrapped up in ideas like the world is too hard, they didn\u2019t give their parents consent to give birth to them, the world is going to be like madmax in a decade, I can\u2019t give birth to a child because of my special unique mental illness, I can\u2019t give birth under capitalism, giving birth is selfish, etc. I guarantee that if they made a new law saying parents get a universal basic income and non parents don\u2019t the vast majority of these people would change their minds. Even single moms would start looking good \n\nPeople will complicate themselves to the ends of the earth out of fear. You aren\u2019t as weak as you think you are, someday you will forget what your childhood felt like, so you won\u2019t compare your current life to it anymore and suddenly life is easy since everything is relative. But the longer you prolong your childhood the harder it will be. Personally I think it would be exciting to be alive for the next mass extinction, we\u2019re all gonna die at some point, you aren\u2019t saving anybody. When you are young the easy options are always desirable, even now it\u2019s crazy for me to believe this but the worst thing for me is too much free time, I used to think the complete opposite. When you are young you question everything and always want to know why, mainly out of a competitive desire to have an edge over others, as you get older you know how and when to avoid asking yourself why, you understand the value of being too busy to ask all the questions and are rewarded with happiness.",

    "text":"&gt;  did little to encourage recipients into employment as hoped\n\nWell, that was not really what was being measured or even a goal of it outright. More like they wanted to see if there was a difference in outcomes in between those \nchronically unemployed getting other benefits and ones who got UBI without conditions alongside what other impacts it might have on various people from assorted \nother demographics. Its outcomes are fairly predictable in many ways in that those who are chronically unemployed likely have specific reasons for it and \"encouragement\" is likely irrelevant to\nwhether they find, or even go seek out work from a given pool of available jobs.  \n\nNow, i personally think that whole \"encouragement\" bit is the reporters personal biasing rather than anything else...and to quote the article; \n\n&gt;The trial was watched closely by other governments who see a basic income as a way of encouraging the unemployed to take up often low-paid or temporary work without fear of losing their benefits.\n\nSure, but where they get that claim from? which governments are looking at it that way outright and only? I mean sure it can be a factor, but as far as i can tell its being looked at on a hell of a lot more\nbroadly than just that. \n\nNow; \n\n&gt;The trial was watched closely by other governments who see a basic income as a way of encouraging the unemployed to take up often low-paid or temporary work without fear of losing their benefits. That could help reduce dependence on the state and cut welfare costs, especially as greater automation sees humans replaced in the workforce.\n\n&gt;The study published on Wednesday echoed researchers\u2019 initial comments from early 2019, shortly after the trial finished, but also showed that those on basic income worked slightly more days than those in the control group of unemployed.\n\nSo in the end it wasn't about \"encouraging to seek work\" outright, but to try and see if on one hand such a system could help compensate for some negative externalities associated with \nthe existing Unemployment benefits and specific shit jobs one. As i mentioned above.. there are usually reasons why the chronically unemployed are so and that may have nothing to do with their willingness to actually work. One such reason might be that one simply can not afford to take on a specific job due to loss of benefits, its temporary nature etc. \n\ni think the way the reporter frames the entire thing is biased on an idea that \"a jobs a job\" which is not true... lots of factors come in to play where some jobs are simply not viable for specific people in given situations.",

And while I admittedly haven't done much research on it, it doesn't seem feasible that it will go from what it is now to fully autonomous in less than fifty or sixty years.\n\nThink about it. Most companies have *just* now begun to switch their trucks over to automatic transmissions. Most truck drivers hate it. Even should autonomous trucks become a common sight in the next twenty years, they're still going to need an ass in the seat and a guy in the cab to take control when necessary. Autonomous interstate driving? Sure, maybe. However, many roads going to a lot of large warehouses, railheads\/terminus, manufacturing plants, ports, distribution centers, retailers, etc. are very rural. Mostly because of the NIMBY types. These roads are also often pretty shitty due to the fact that there are big heavy fucking trucks running over them almost 24\/7. And I've seen some of these roads. You put an autonomous truck on that? It's gonna end up in a ditch within fifty feet. Plus, factor in weather conditions, traffic, etc.\n\nThe autonomy thing seems a little far-fetched to me, at least right now. I imagine within fifteen to twenty years the trucking industry *might* have some sort of 'autopilot' for interstate driving where the driver essentially just observes and takes manual control when necessary. Full autonomy in the truck driving industry is a long ways away in my opinion.\n\nPeople seem very excited for this autonomy thing but they fail to realize the massive void that will be left by it should it develop quickly. Entire sections of people will suddenly become invalid. Their life's work, experience and training will be rendered worthless. It'll take food off of their family's tables. It's going to get very ugly if it does happen with little adjustment period and as a society we'll probably have to talk about some kind of universal basic income. Not that anything will ever get done. People are content to let people starve and die in ditches and just step over the corpses so that Scrooge McDuck can afford his next yacht.\n\nAnyway, I don't see it happening. Not for a long time anyway. I think we'll see it in public transit before we see it in trucking. Autonomous buses will likely come first and perhaps autonomous boxtrucks for urban deliveries, but not big rigs. Transit has always been an issue in the US anyway considering our rail network is absolute and utter shit compared to most nations.

It's not the actual being a single parent that's the problem - it's that society as a whole doesn't value people enough to create the social safety nets needed to help people like you function as a valuable member of society and to raise your kid as one.  If you had, say, free day care, more help with transportation, and probably more assistance with money\/food\/lodging, I bet you would have that little bit of extra time and money to look after yourself.  Which is healthier in general for you, for your kid, and for our society.  Your kid shouldn't have to grow up with his parent not being able to take care of her own needs, and that's not a you issue - that's a society issue.\n\n\n\n\nIt's like all of the studies done and real world examples where if we provide homeless people with a place to live and be based out of (like small apartments), they are less likely to end up in the hospital with a serious weather related condition, they are more likely to eat better, they are more likely to be able to find a job, and then stair step their way back to a normal life.  The cost of the housing the homeless actually reduced costs of taking care of their medical needs, policing, etc. and it's still looked down on.  Everyone likes to think they are so far removed from a homeless situation, but we are all so much closer to that than we care to admit.  Universal basic income is gaining traction in some countries and having a positive impact.\n\n\n\n\nI hope that you do well in the future and that our society as a whole gets their collective heads out of their asses so that we can help each other live normal lives.

I consider transplant medicine one of the greatest medical miracles of our time, but in the current state it is fighting a battle it can't win. \n\nAutomated vehicles might accelerate the downward trend further but the number of traffic accidents has been been falling since the early 70s, largely due to better safety standars. And just as technology gets better at keeping us out of harms way, medicine gets better at keeping us alive if we do get injured or sick. Great news for us, conflicting news for those that require organ donations.\n\nAnd just as these would-be donors get to live, more and more people get old enough to develop diseases that can require organ transplant. Stuff that would've been fatal just years ago becomes merely chronical, but over time damages some organ. And since transplant surgeons and experts are getting more experienced and more confident in their techniques, they accept many patients to be listed that would've been considered \"unfit for transplant\" before, either due to old age, poor health or other factors.\n\nIt really is a feedback loop; the same mechanics that generate an increased need in organs also reduce the number of potential donors. No amount of social or political reform can change this dynamic unless you ban all safety regulations and force doctors to ignore decades of medical progress.\n\nRegenerative medicine and artificially grown organs could not only cure the need for organ donors dead or alive (thus avoiding all ethical problems involved), they also have the potential to make the lives of those who receive organs both better and longer. \n\nWith current technology all organ recipients are subject to life-long immunosuppression. For many organ transplant is a cruel tradeoff; you pay for a chance of survival and health with a constant risk of rejection, a crippled immune system, a steep increase in cancer risk and other problems too numerous to name. All of that is far more agreeable than acute organ failure and not everyone is affected to the same degree but nobody should have to make such a choice. \n\nIt seems we've strayed far from basic income, but as you said: it really isn't a problem that can be solved by politics or economics.",

The deficit of these programs will only get bigger each year.\n\nThe total liability minus the total tax revenue will be almost $50 trillion cumulative over that time frame.\n\nIn order to increase tax revenue of the current existing taxes by $600 billion, you need an increase of $3.7 trillion in GDP.\n\nGDP will drop $900b first from the new taxes.

However that's one of those points where a traditional notion of labor and capital will break down because traditionally businesses want their customers rich and their workers poor, it's only now that companies like Wal-Mart are beginning to realize their workers are their customers. So in other words- fuck me if I know we're dealing with an entirely new paradigm.

He tanked his chances in another run when he said Robert Kennedy's supporters were \"not intelligent.\" In all, he ran for president 5 times and, when he ran as a democrat, lost every time by consistently showing contempt for his running mates in national debates. He is known as the face of the anti-war left \"New Party\" and vindictively attacking former allies in pretty brutal terms. \n\nEugene McCarthy also was all over the map politically, so he had lots of former allies because his positions shifted throughout his career. He left the democratic party to run as an independent and was campaigning for the Libertarian party when he said this. Saying that he was \"not a conservative\" isn't exactly true; although he once claimed to be the \"most liberal\" democratic presidential candidate, he's a complicated character who is widely regarded as turning to the right late in his career, when he said this quote. \n\nHere are two examples of his rightward shift. He helped sponsor, early in his career, a bill which eased the immigration requirements for family members of us citizens, but then later in life repudiated that bill and became part of the board of an anti-immigration, nativist group, saying that his own bill \"would eventually lead to unprecedented growth in numbers and the transfer of policy control from the elected representatives of the American people to individuals wishing to bring relatives to this country.\"  That anti-immigration group was FAIR and is designated a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC); FAIR opposes both illegal and legal immigration. Despite being the counter culture candidate early in his career by being willing to meet with Che Guevara, by stating that he would accept a coalition government in Saigon that included communists, starting the anti-war \"New Party,\" and campaigning for president on a government mandated 4 day work week platform; he vigorously opposed Nixon's negative income tax (an idea similar to basic income) late in life and campaigned for Ronald Reagan's foreign policy.\n\nHe's a complicated guy prone to shifting positions and attacking allies. This quote says more about Gene than it does Carter.\n\nTLDR: imagine firebrands Alan Grayson or Ted Cruz, with their histories of attacking their own party in often way-too-personal and over-the-top ways for not having sufficient purity, suddenly switching positions and parties at the end of their careers.

How Accessibility To Lunch Impacts Student Learning](https:\/\/soeonline.american.edu\/blog\/what-is-lunch-shaming)\n\nWhat Is Lunch Shaming? How Accessibility to Lunch Impacts Student Learning\n\nTuesday, June 30, 2020\n\n\ufffc\n\nWhat is lunch shaming? Imagine a high school cafeteria in which a student\u2019s meal is taken away and thrown in the trash in front of his peers because his lunch account had an outstanding balance of $4.95. In another school, a student\u2019s breakfast was thrown away due to a 30-cent debt. And one school denied a child breakfast even though the child\u2019s mother told the school over the phone that she was on her way there to pay for it.\nThese scenarios are just a few examples of lunch shaming, a practice in many schools that is intended to shame students and their parents into paying overdue meal bills to the schools.\nThe detrimental impact of lunch shaming on students extends beyond the embarrassment and indignities they experience from being treated as inferior. A lack of regular nutritious meals affects students\u2019 physical and mental health; it also impairs their cognitive ability. By examining the causes of lunch shaming, parents, educators, and policy makers can devise winning strategies to combat the practice.\n\nHow Flawed School Funding Leads to Lunch Shaming\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) free school lunch program serves 29.7 million students. Free lunches are available to students whose households have income at or below 130 percent of poverty. Reduced prices of 40 cents for lunch and 30 cents for breakfast are offered to children whose household income is between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty.\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) states that lunch shaming is the result of the way schools fund their breakfast and lunch programs. State and federal government agencies place students into two categories: those who qualify for assistance under the USDA program\u2019s guidelines and those who must pay the set price for school-provided meals.\n\n&gt;However, many students fall into a third category: their family income exceeds the thresholds set by the school lunch programs, but the families cannot afford to pay for their school meals. While every state operates some form of school lunch program, many of these programs are \u201coptional and self-supporting,\u201d according to the ABA. This prevents them from receiving government funding, although they may accept federal and state cash aid, federal commodities, and charitable donations.\n\nAlso -- and this is purely my own initial reaction, and I'm admittedly not an expert on the topic -- income relative to poverty level seems to be an arbitrary way to determine whether someone can afford school lunches. There are so many ways that other uncontrollable and unexpected situations can put families into crippling debt. A cancer diagnosis or car accident, for example. A divorce could also complicate things.\n\nMaking sure Every. Single. Child. who either cannot afford a meal or forgets their lunch or lunch money can eat is the most important factor. It may even require fewer resources to make sure everyone gets a free meal than it would to filter out those who can afford it. I don't have the data on it, but that's one of the arguments for UBI: It would cost more to limit who got it than it would to give it to everyone.",

Incremental change in regards to slave wages is like saying we should\u2019ve incrementally given liberties to African slaves following emancipation. Any rational minded person would say that they should\u2019ve been liberated in their entirety immediately, so why not the same thing when capital owners exploit the working class to the point of extreme poverty?\n\nAnd for the record, setting the end goal at a $10 minimum wage wouldn\u2019t have done a goddamn thing to fix the problems of the current minimum wage. $15\/hour is just above the poverty line in many places in the US, $10\/hour gives those same impoverished workers just a few more crumbs in their impoverished lives. Nobody should live in poverty. We can have conversations about UBI when someone actually fights to implement it, but for the time being, with this administration, the only option was to raise the minimum wage to $15\/hour, and we couldn\u2019t even do that.

Money are still consolidating in the hands of the 1% which is not feasible in an UBI scenario. Also i don't think automation has the necessary yield to sustain it either. I mean there are great advances, but mostly it is pioneer work, and for UBI we need mature technologies. Not to mention we can't implement this over night because of social inertia. We need to start working on our redistribution schemes, a new social contract were we take indeed more from the rich and give to the pour, while everyone conforming, basically enhancing today's welfare programs. One of the idea of capitalism, is that if you overtax work and tangible achievements, progress will slow, as anyone wouldn't be interested that much to fight for the marginal dollar if some entity takes for 90 cents from it. And the problem is that even today when taxation isn't that high (compared to an UBI scenario), people still do whatever they can to hide their assets. so the question is how do we change these people, how do we change the paradigm, without using some type of class war bullshit (check communism revolution), or better said how can we change a wolf into a sheep*^^1? can it be done as we walk or just force this through education hoping that in half a century wolfs will die out on their own and be replaced by \"sheeps\"?\n\nAnother aspect is that this consume based society on which we based today's growth (but if you ask me it is somehow a ponzi scheme, if the pie doesn't get bigger over time the system crumbles) has to be replaced with a version of the theoretical resource based society that is preached here and there as an utopian holy grail of human civilization. In other words no more overproduction, no more so much wasted energy and capital on things that are meaningless like aggressive advertising, most of the time misleading (just think how much the advertising budgets are at a global level, and what is their impact on the final cost of a product) when in a resource based society just providing transparent information about a product should suffice, and the rest is done through education of the consumer.  \n\n1*see the wolf vs. sheep metaphor from a predatory instinct perspective, as individualism vs collectivism, as hyper competition vs fair cooperation, and not as the traditional independent and smart vs weak and stupid.

    "text":"This is the proper groundwork for a second definition of socialism, that I think makes sense of much of what socialists do. You can see socialist policies as \\*means\\* through which we bring about communism as an \\*end\\*. As support for this, I will point out that no major country has ever declared itself to have achieved \"communism.\" They had communist parties, but not a communist society (just like how we have a democratic party and a green party in the US, but that doesn't automatically mean we are totally democratic or totally green). The closest anyone taken seriously came to saying they had achieved communism was when Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union \\*was going to\\* achieve it in the following 30 years. Khrushchev had a reputation for being hyperbolic. Communism is usually described as a society where social relations of production and technology have either become so efficient or automated that most human needs (not wants) can be accounted for with a minimum of coercion. In its ideal scenario, a formal state apparatus ceases to be necessary in order to force people to work or behave because they have less to fight for.\n\nIf this sounds like a \"pie-in-the-sky\" dream, that's because it is. Most socialists would agree that it is. That's why Marx generally thought it was an uninteresting topic. \"Communism\" under this definition functions more as a guiding light, almost like the North Star. We may not ever be able to go there, but it can help us orient ourselves and get us moving in the right direction. Socialist policies, in this analysis, are more pragmatic; they are more concerned with what we can do now than with what we'd like to do in some ideal scenario. Sure, lots of socialists use utopian language, but it tends to be more for motivational purposes, to get us thinking about what kinds of things we'd like to change once we start thinking about the present world again.\n\nI personally do not care for this distinction between socialism and communism as much though. But I'd have to start bringing in my own analytic categories to explain exactly what I mean. Suffice it to say, socialism is more concerned with distribution in my opinion, while communism is more concerned with production. Because of this, socialism trends towards centralization in a way that communism wouldn't necessarily do so.\n\nSo when you say that you can't imagine a socialist society doing any differently, I will concede that merely nationalizing all firms will not save the economy. Consumption of resources and production of waste is what needs to decrease. What we need is a sustainable economy. No profit-driven economy is sustainable since it will always need to grow. However, if production in the marketplace was not a means for ever-expanding profit, if it instead was tailored to human needs (either through democratized production or socialized distribution) then you are going to remove the incentive to overconsume resources and overproduce waste purely in the service of profit. We produce many products we don't need, and we waste a lot because convenience is more profitable than frugality (fast food is an example of this, where they will cook a lot of food that they know they will waste in some percentage because the profit they get from always having food available for convenience outweighs the cost of waste). And frankly, in a society that has better (fewer) hours for a living wage (due to automation, UBI, or efficient work arrangements), we'd probably all be a lot more patient and would have less of a need for convenient, fast food.\n\nBut alas, you are probably thinking of our two main examples of Socialist societies, the USSR and the People's Republic of China. Well, it is important to remember that these were both agrarian economies when their revolutions occurred. Marx's analysis is basically that capitalism and industrialization had ended scarcity. We now knew how to produce more than we needed (so much that we occasionally had economic collapses from overproduction). But capitalism had failed to end poverty, despite ending scarcity. He hoped for revolutions in fully industrialized countries, where the means to overcome scarcity were already in place and thus a society was possible that demands less work. However, communist parties have only had successful revolutions in agrarian countries where industrialization had not yet run its course. If you wonder about the industrialization or collectivization in the Soviet Union or Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, you are essentially looking at efforts to compress a century or two of industrialization into a decade or two. Frankly, industrialization is not a pretty process (just pick up a Charles Dickins novel to see). And trying to speed an already destructive and difficult process up caused a lot of damage. Now, they felt the need to catch up to their capitalist neighbors who had attempted (or succeeded) to invade their country and overthrow the new government. In that situation, I think anyone would feel impatient with slower forms of industrialization. Anyway, so when people outside the socialist tradition think of examples of \u201csocialism\u201d they either think of these two examples, which were each more or less as bad for the environment as industrialization was anywhere else or they instead (incorrectly) look at Modern China\u2026 which is probably better described as a bureaucratic capitalist system, where CEO\u2019s are appointed by the party bureaucracy.\n\nThese are certainly not very good examples of \u201csocialism in action.\u201d And even if you look at societies with many more socialist institutions than we have, I can\u2019t think of any good examples of societies which are primarily socialist rather than primarily capitalist with socialist institutions on top. I will confess near complete lack of knowledge about modern Latin American politics though, so one of the nominally socialist countries to our south could be illustrative. I have no clue.\n\nI still want to come back to my prior point though, the profit\/growth incentives in a capitalist society are ecologically unsustainable and untenable. These two motives do not necessarily exist in a socialist society, and so removing our incentives to consume resources and produce waste beyond what is necessary to account for our actual needs is an extremely important step. Moving to more efficient or abundant forms of energy (solar, geothermal, tidal, wind, hydro, etc. Hell, even some forms of Nuclear are clearly better in the short term than fossil fuels) is extremely important, but I suspect will be harder within a capitalist framework, since it relies on economically divergent interests to all collaborate against their own short-term, self-interest. After that, changes to consumption could probably take place over a longer period of time. I\u2019m convinced that many of our bad habits really come down to how little free time we are given away from our jobs, and how many corners we will cut in order to salvage as much of what is left as possible (for example, bad driving, not recycling, eating fast food, eating a familiar and therefore stereotyped and less diverse diet since learning new foods takes time and energy). Maybe if our economic system was not built on pitting us against each other in a competitive structure, we\u2019d be more habitually inclined to help each other out, to share. And maybe in a society with less symbolic value given to wealth, we\u2019d all do a lot less conspicuous or self-gratifying forms of consumption. For all these reasons, I would bet a socialist society to be better for the environment than a capitalist one.\n\n**&lt;Excursis&gt;** I hope that in my attempted care in responding to your first answer that I have laid enough groundwork that I needn't go into as much detail on each other question. I am happy to develop any of what I've said further, provided I feel like you are operating in good faith (as it seemed to me that you were earlier in this thread). But I hope that the structure of my first response will help acquaint you with how many of us here reason and the general structure of centrist views that we don't like. I hope to make that clearer in a summary.",

But I will close it off with my last arguments.\n\n&gt; When evaluating whether it's cheaper to automate a process, you include the entire lifecycle of said robot. Maintenance is included in the TCO calculations. If automation required tons of human labor, no one would bother to automate as it defeats the entire purpose.\nOf course there will still be a need for a human workforce to monitor the automation, but this is only a very small amount compared to the workforce being replaced.\n\nYes, you would have to include the entire life cycle of the robot. But, there can always be unexpected things that can pop up. And automation *does* require a ton of human labor, and it's not practical for applications that require a constant shift in focus or a constant different things being done. This applies to many more jobs then you might suspect. Like I said, Robots are only good for a few things, while humans can be taught many.\n\nLets take our personal assistants like Google now, siri, cortana they all fit. Sure, they are convenient. They will allow me to search with my voice quickly or such. But are they really efficient? I find myself that even though I have an echo dot, I never use it because I can usually get something done on my PC faster. The reminders although cool can be sometimes inconvenient to setup by voice if the assistant cannot recognize your voice, maybe you have a heavy accent. Regardless, its often easier to do it yourself then have something to replace. That's another reason why human clerks will always remain a thing; robots are only good for a select number of tasks, and only what it has been programmed for. Take a repair shop or something, sure a robot might be there to place a request, but there will always be someone on the other side.\n\nIts not always more convenient to have a machine do it versus a human. \n\n&gt; Because it's not nice to have people die on the streets because of poverty?\n\n[According to this study by Columbia university in 2011, only 4.5% of deaths are attributed to some form of poverty.](https:\/\/www.mailman.columbia.edu\/public-health-now\/news\/how-many-us-deaths-are-caused-poverty-lack-education-and-other-social-factors) That is a REALLY low (well high but low in terms of the whole population.) percentage of deaths attributed. I bet its actually lowering by the economy getting better. And by taking more taxes and making more people poor, you just increase the amount of deaths made by poverty. Like I said, it always comes out of the pocket.\n\nAnd like I also said, this is why we have welfare. Basic income isn't going to change that. Basic income, is still poverty.\n\n&gt; It definitely isn't perfect, but it's guaranteed to be the future.\n\nOf course. But there will still be a place for people in these fields. \n\nI would invite you to make one last rebuttal or end the convo here, and then make a new thread or PM me if you want to continue.",

I been renting my whole life and it fucking sucks. I give a third of my income away so someone can essentialy do nothing and retain the right to the property. I've literally paid other peoples mortgages and i have nothing to show for it. \n\ni live in major urban area, new housing isn't always an option, new apartments near downtown are often gentrified with high price tags, affordable homes are often much farther away requiring up to a 2 hour commute in rush hour traffic one way. that means your spending 12 hours of your time for 8 hours of pay just to own a home. Unfortunately, housing costs are so high that an addition of $1000 income wont be enough to buy rather than rent for the vast majority of low income earners. \n\nthe best possibility for me owning a home within a reasonable commute to work, would be if the UBI was insistuted and million others just like me arent trying to do the exact same thing driving up demand. that means i cannot wait for it to go into effect i got to place a bid on a home, hopefully before they even sign the bill. \n\nevery industry has people to analyze markets and demographics to find how much money different people have and where they are spending it. so they are well aware of how people in my situation might respond. \n\ni remember attending corporate conferences back when just before Obama-care came out. They were extremely excited and happy over the fact that an otherwise untapped market was suddenly going to spend billions of dollars on health-care. Now i don't mean that it came out of pocket, it was the government who provided the billions. a literal subsidy. \n\nDespite doing some good for alot of people, Obama-care didn't resolve a number of major issues people were relying on to do so. Health care is still an problem. Similary, UBI will have a similar impact on afford-housing, however it will still be an problem. \n\nSo i'm basically modelling my predictions for UBI based on my experiences with Obama-care. But instead of a direct or literaly subsidy, it is a indirect  or virtual subsidy. Subsidies don't always make things cheaper like they should, it depends on context and oversight. \nUBI and Obama-care have different mechanisms but essentially the same effect, that is i think landlords, banks, and the housing market will do quite well due to UBI much like pharmaceuticals, healthcare providers and insurance companies did due to Obama. but you'll probably disagree, and that's ok. maybe you will be right idk.",

Instead of 44k a year per person, let's bring it down to 20k a year per person(which is certainly more reasonable seeing as the point of UBI is to provide basic needs without having to work.) Reduce spending on other areas, like military which takes a very disproportional amount of money compared to what we actually should be spending on military. Welfare and Medicaid systems will be gone since UBI will cover that. And then finally we can rescale our tax system to take more from big business and anyone who makes more than, let's say, a million dollars per year. As businesses start to automate their jobs and in doing so providing less jobs for the people, they should be expected to take a higher tax rate to help the people that no longer have a job. \n\nI think in order to survive the mass unemployment that automation will bring, we have to conform to the idea that we must take some of the wealth from the top, and spread it to the common people. Even if some people find it \"unfair\" and \"these companies earned their money, why should we give it to people who don't even work\", it may be our only option to prevent mass starvation.\n\nUltimately if we look ahead to the far future, this period of UBI will be temporary.

    "text":"&gt;Inconsistent  Drug Policy: Granted Tulsi doesn't have the most consistent of drug  legalization policies either, but Yang is pretty bad and he's all over  the map. Example #1: And I would pardon everyone who's in jail for a  non-violent drug related offense. Example #2: Q: So only marijuana, not  all non-violent drug offenders. YANG: Yes, that's correct. Example #3:  Decriminalize small quantities of opioid use and possession. (Bold  emphasis mine to illustrate contradictions)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How are these contradictionary statements?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pardon  is for all non-violent marijuana drug offenders, with maybe additional  room for other drugs but starting with marijuna. Pardons are only for  people already convicted.\n\nThe contradiction is simple. Yang said, \"And I would pardon everyone who's in jail for a  non-violent drug related offense.\".  He didn't say possession only (he used the term \"related\")...and he didn't say only for marijuana...but for \"drug related offenses\".  Then he says it is just for a small amount of possession and only for marijuana and opioids.  \n\n&gt;Nuclear  works perfectly well with renewables because nuclear gives you the   baseline you need and then renewable+battery takes care of the rest.\n\nThat baseline is an issue though.  Demand for electricity through a day can vary dramatically.  At the same time supply from wind\/solar can also vary greatly.  Nuclear can't ramp up and down capacity quickly to match...which means it is a poor compliment for renewables.  This is why California which has a large number of wind\/solar farms is using natural gas to compliment renewables...as that IS flexible.\n\n&gt;Website  regulations: EU already has the GDPR guidelines that force companies to  set up their data in such a way that it is easy to delete and e.g.  tables have fields specifying which rows (cause they are tied to person  x) can be used for models or not.\n\nIn real life I'm an IT worker.  I can assure this isn't easy.  the GDPR guidelines were very controversial.  Most of what websites do now to \"comply\" is to show a simple popup asking users to agree to their guidelines before entering.  I'm not aware of many if any websites that offer the level of user control that Yang is requesting.\n\nYes tables have rows and fields...but often tables point to other relational tables.   Some derivative data be difficult to selectively prune.  NoSQL setups can be even tricky...and this doesn't even get into cases of backups which would be a nightmare to scrub.\n\n&gt;Department  of Attention Economy Given the fact suicide rates, in particular among  young girls, are increasing year on year starting the adoption of  smartphones+facebook.. I don't think its a bad thing to do. We ban  smoking for underage but phones\/apps are basically dopamine slot  machines and those are completely unregulated. But okay its a comparison  between tulci and yang.\n\nI'm actually concerned about smartphones too.  But I don't think a government agency with its associated cost and bureaucracy is the right answer.  Such an agency could make developing smartphone apps a nightmare.\n\n&gt;Automation  In pretty much any interview he mentions automation is the cause of  many problems but we should not try to stop it, yet bring  government\/society up to speed with automation. What you describe is  completely the opposite of his position. He even warns that there will  be groups of people (e.g. truck drivers) actively protesting automation  unless we take measures now and support there lives and the transition  better. Nowhere does he mention stopping automation.\n\nTruck drivers will likely never be automated in our life time.  Self driving cars are technically too difficult now.  They struggle with unexpected situations and they don't understand intent. \n\n&gt;VAT  value added tax is a tax on the added value. So if i buy something for  $95 and sell it for $100 I pay the 10% tax on the $5 difference. So the  current company pays $0.50. Now if the raw materials at beginning of  supply chain are $10 and you have many companies adding value and   buying\/selling, once you got to $100 \"value\" then total tax paid by all  companies in supply chain is 10% \\* $90 is $9.\n\nTypical VAT is applied to the sale price...expenses are not deductable.  Yes, a retailer can get a credit but this is based on the previous VAT paid by upstream suppliers...and not the markup.  Here is a nice chart that explains how VAT works.\n\n[https:\/\/www.heritage.org\/sites\/default\/files\/\\~\/media\/images\/reports\/2010\/b2503\/b2503\\_chart1\\_750px.jpg](https:\/\/www.heritage.org\/sites\/default\/files\/~\/media\/images\/reports\/2010\/b2503\/b2503_chart1_750px.jpg)\n\nIf Yang is deviating from this and applying a different variant of VAT that allows the deductions of expenses, please post a link sourcing this.\n\n&gt;All  cost increases are paid by consumer or profit\/dividend reduction and  its estimated its around 50\/50. Its regressive on its own but if you  implement UBI you end up enormously progressive. Adding progressive  taxes to UBI would make the \"progressive-ness\" skyrocket, its not  needed. You can't look at only taxes and conclude whether they are  progressive\/regressive, you always need to consider transfers as well.\n\nOnly for the very poor would enjoy net positive \"progressive-ness\".  Otherwise this is mostly paid for and then supplied to the middle class.  It's circular with no real benefit.",

As for everything else, clearly you have no idea what you are talking about regarding where things are headed. Stocking jobs will definitely be replaced by robots and automation and customer service largely has already in most industries. You will see a push by the stores for curbside pickup an delivery as well. As it is there are like two cashiers, a single customer service person at the counter, two occasionally. Then there is a babysitter of the self checkout lane. Those jobs will go away as technology improves. These jobs will be replaced sooner if costs go up. Customer service will be taken off site to a central location. We've already seen reduced interaction with human employees in the store and that's not a trend we will see reversed. The good news is there will always be skilled jobs servicing these robots and AI. For the low income menial jobs of today, these people will learn a skill or be put on a Universal Basic Income.

I have a realistic view of where things are going, whether you like it or not. The unions should instead be pushing the parent company for free education in order to save as many of them as possible for skilled jobs or if they can't repurpose them within the company, be trained in a skill they can use at another job.

Or you have to get people to work effectively for nothing extra (because you aren't adding to productive capacity) to produce bread and houses and then take them to give to those without. \n\nIn short you have no choice but to tax the poor and the workers, since you are using an unemployed buffer stock solution.

Capable of learning anything on it's own, even how to control\/live inside whatever device you connect it to.  But, instead of selling it for other companies to use as a workforce, he gets the bright idea that he would just buy the companies and use the AI for himself.  \n\nHe first buys mines and replaces all of the workers with AI.  Then shipping companies.  Then manufacturing facilities.  Etc.  Uses the leftover profits to have the AIs build more AIs to take over other industries. \n\nPretty soon he owns and operates everything.  From the ground to your house, is all automated, by him.  There are no jobs left.  100% unemployability.   100% of the money goes to him.  Until there is no money left.  What then?  \n\nWhat's the point in making all of this if no one can buy any of it?  Moreover, what's the point in even capturing the cash?  He doesn't need to pay for anything that his robots make.   He realizes that not only has his keeping the cash for himself not accomplished anything, but people are starving and protesting.  Trying to kill him, or hack the robots, etc.  \n\nSo, what are the options for him?    \n\nHe could distribute his cash.  UBI.. But what's the point?   Couldn't he just get rid of the concept of cash and give people what they want?   What happens if they all want yachts?  Castles?  Space stations? .... turns out that even in a post-scarcity environment, scarcity still plays a role.  So, cash helps limit and track who gets how much.  But it also means that no one gets a life of luxury.  And creates opportunity for undesirable issues, like gambling, drugs, etc.  If there's nothing to trade then there wont be such trade.  \n\nWhat if he distributed control of the robots?  Everyone get's so many, and whatever they want is what they set theirs to?  But how does that work when what you need is something like a computer, which needs materials from all over the world?  Should their community robots set to do the raw, distributed work?  What people who want more forcing others control their robots for their own good?  Coercion, extortion, etc.  \n\nWhat if we instead have the robot's put us into a VR where we _can_ have whatever we want? That there is no scarcity whatsoever?

How can we propagate the species, both on earth and across the universe, without RL interaction?  \n\nSo, what's the answer?  There doesn't seem to be any one good answer in my mind.  And I don't think we're going to come up with one until we're there.  Because we flat out cannot predict what comes next.  What the AI may come up with.  Something may change the entire game well before we even need to worry about any of this.  So, it's fairly pointless to discuss, but still fun.  ",

    "text":"&gt; The people who own capital and employ others\n\nOK, so I hire Joe to help cut my grass. Am I thereby a member of the \"capitalist class\"? How about my late uncle who co-owned an auto-body shop in South Jersey: he lived in a small house with his public school teacher wife worth maybe $200,000 in 2019. He and the guys at the shop sometimes hired high school kids to help sweep the shop up. Are these guys kith and kin with Andrew Carnegie? \n\n&gt; especially those who own that capital through state advantage, e.g. legalistic advantages through licensing, intellectual property and eminent domain.\n\nI see what you mean about licensing, but as I am sure you know, in the modern economy where labor unions have been decimated, licensing has exploded as a kind of replacement for unions. Licensing erects a barrier to entry for employment and thereby keeps the supply of labor low and wages high, because consumers have fewer alternatives for licensed services. In fact, if you Wiki up \"occupational licensing\" you'll see a great graph that shows the direct inverse relationship between the decline of unions and the rise of licensing. As unions go down, licensing goes up. \n\nAs far as IP I take your point, especially with prescription drug companies who tend to piggyback of National Institutes of Health research. I see no reason why this specific function shouldn't be socialized. But in the absence of any patent\/IP system whatsoever, what incentive would there be for research and development? If someone else will immediately be able to provide my new service at a lower cost (like Facebook with social media innovations), why should I even develop them in the first place? I'll put in the time and effort but won't make any money off it, and I'll take a loss. Now, this doesn't mean that IP rights should be *permanent*, and that's no the system that we have right now. After a certain period, IP rights expire altogether. The only place that I think this is a truly serious problem is with prescription drugs and other medical treatments. Although perhaps I am overlooking other issues here. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean with eminent domain. I understand the concept and anyone who has their real estate transferred via eminent domain will get fair market value for it. I disagree with the Kelo court's ideology that eminent domain should be available for non-state uses like casinos and industrial parks, but I think we're much better off in a world where we can build an interstate highway system or a rail line instead of letting someone hold up construction of things like that. \n\n&gt; I have a friend who owns some stock and yet is at the mercy of an awful job that he hates and only recently quit thanks to some savings, that is not a capitalist.\n\nThat's the definition of a capitalist, strictly speaking. He owns stock in a business corporation. That means he owns a share of the corporation. He gets to vote for the directors of the corporation. This is why I don't think this distinction makes any sense; ditto for the Retirement Fund example. These people own capital. They delegate management of the affairs of the corporation to a board of directors, who in turn delegate it further down the chain of command, especially when it comes to ordinary hiring and firing distinctions. The CEO of McDonald's and the Board of Directors of McDonald's do not make individual hiring and firing decisions on the ground level. \n\nIt seems to me that your problem is with *management,* not *capitalists*, and you've just latched onto the old Marxist jawn to describe something totally different. \n\n&gt; That is such an isolated idea of what profits actually look like that has no real bearing on our economy. When two people trade resources in a vacuum that is just a trade. But when someone makes money off another's labor without doing the work themselves and taking some of that money for themselves, that is the profit being discussed.\n\nIt's the same thing. I have something that Employer wants more than what he has (time and effort). Employer has something that I want more than what I have (money and benefits.) We trade what we have with each other because it's a good deal for both of us. What am I missing here? I think I understand your position but it just doesn't make any concrete sense. \n\nImagine I'm a construction worker. I get hired by a construction firm. They pay me money and maybe give me benefits, and I give them my time and effort in exchange. They are going to make money off of my labor (they think.) Would I have been able to make every cent of profit from my labor if I tried to shop my services to clients directly? I don't think so; my labor was actually only useful to someone and thus profitable because I was able to team up with an employer who hired a lot of other people and directed our labor in a way that resulting in something getting built. I couldn't have built it on my own and the client would not have hired me. To me, that sounds like a win for everyone: employer gets money, I get paid, and client gets their building. What am I missing? \n\n&gt;Oh Jesus. Come on, the failure of public defenders is so well known even liberals like John Oliver have tackled this (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=USkEzLuzmZ4). This is a side issue, but the fact that you have such little knowledge about how the justice system works is worrying.\n\nI think you're the one who doesn't understand how the legal system works because I was describing the process of (1) a *civil* lawsuit where (2) the employee would be the *plaintiff* (in other words, the person initiating the lawsuit) and the employer would be the defendant. If you don't understand something that basic, your legal analysis is not credible. \n\n&gt; Do you even see what you are writing? Do you think people from marginalized communities have the time or capital to file a lawsuit against someone who had a higher position of power over you to begin with?\n\nRemember what I said about how plaintiff's lawyers work on something called *contingency fees*? That means that they do *not* bill by the hour or charge a lump sum. Whether or not they get paid depends on whether or not they end up winning or settling their cases on behalf of their clients. It is set up that way *precisely* because prospective clients of plaintiffs lawyers generally do not have the money to pay up front but are willing to give up a slice of a damages award or settlement in order to pursue a lawsuit. Does that make sense? \n\n&gt; Why do you trust the authorities so much? If the authorities were such trustworthy folks, don't you think we would have a UBI already?\n\nYou're equivocating on what \"authorities\" means. The kinds of \"authorities\" who would arrest an employer who steals or makes physical threats against an employee are judges, juries, and attorneys. They are *not* the same people who decide whether or not America would have a UBI-based social safety net. That kind of thing is decide by the *legislature*, i.e. Congress.\n\nIf you've got enough evidence to bring a lawsuit, you can file it on a contingency (read: no money down, only pay if you win) basis and a judge (who is not financially interested in the outcome of the case) will get to decide if you've got enough evidence to proceed to discovery. You don't need to prove your case at this stage; discovery is about getting enough evidence to prove your case. You just need to plead enough facts so that you are plausibly entitled to relief. If your lawsuit is frivolous, it will get dismissed. If it has potential merit (not slam-dunk merit, just more than a scintilla of evidence to back it up) you get discovery. At this point your employer will probably already be interested in settling the case because discovery is a hideous b-i-t-c you-know-what of a process.  \n\n&gt; I've already discussed the dangers in my previous response but to sum them up: Sexual harassment, discrimination, emotional abuse, and physical harm in some extreme cases\n\nLawsuits get filed over these things *all the time.*",

Savings from other programs and raising new revenue. \n\nA big concept of the freedom dividend is its savings front. E.g. someone that leaves jail will get $1k\/mo which is a highly appealing alternative given that their options usually are struggle to find a job or commit a crime and go back to guaranteed food\/shelter\/etc. Re-incarceration rates are pretty high which is not good for a country with high incarceration rates. Then there will be natural welfare consolidation. Administering cashlike benefits like SNAP etc are huge money pits in regards to helping people and the amount of administration overhead especially because politicians love to means test. All that really means is that to eliminate a small possibility of abuse, they want to add a fixed amount of guaranteed inefficiency. Usually, this doesn't solve the problem either... Either way these changes should add up to substantial savings at the cost of smaller government. \n\nAdditional money for the dividend will be raised through a wealth redistribution mechanism. Wealth taxes are notoriously difficult to execute so you really have 3 options: sales, income, or property. Property taxes are difficult to calculate. Income taxes could work but the richest people can deduct their way out. Thus, you're left with sales tax (sales tax being the ELI5 friendly term. There is a huge difference with how a VAT actually works). Yang proposes a 10% VAT and european countries are at 20%. For a majority of american citizens, there is no way we would spend more than $10k\/mo\/person which is how much would need to be spent to be &gt; 10% of tax even if you include every single possible transaction (some will be tax free just like how our current sales tax works). Thus, a majority of america will benefit greatly from the $1k\/mo. \n\nHowever, if you think about who will pay greatly from a sales tax perspective, its not people per se. It's business. Flights, commercial properties, etc. Businesses will be paying significantly into a VAT system and this is what Yang means when a behemoth like amazon can deduct their income taxes to 0 but will HAVE to pay VAT due to the expenses incurred during business operation. The humorous thing is that its not clear whether their profits will decrease as giving americans $1k\/mo will significantly increase buying power. Thus, you probably see major corporations lobby against UBI.",

The reason communism fails is because it doesn't recognize that humans are selfish.  UBI works BECAUSE humans are selfish. They want more.  You know what I would do if I got an extra $1,000 per month from UBI?  Keep working my current job, because I don't want $12k per year, I want a hell of a lot more.   \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt;Funny you should raise the idea of single-payer healthcare as if the idea that other countries have that, it must mean that UBI could work, too. \n\nThat's not what I said, try strawmanning harder.  I said, I've seen the same overly simplified and dismissive rhetoric concerning single payer, and you need to give a better argument.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\&gt; Why are you not getting the idea that UBI can\u2019t work because if  everyone\u2019s getting it, that has to mean that they\u2019re just paying  themselves their own money?! \n\nBecause that's not true.  Yes, we pay taxes on social security, and those taxes could never fuel social security alone. But we also pay taxes on all our other income.  The overwhelming majority of people are not going to be happy making $12,000 per year.  They are going to to get another job, and pay taxes on that income.  Based on the scheme there is going to be a break even income, where people over that income pay in, more than they get out.  \n\nUBI is a wealth transfer mechanism that pools a small subset of our money together, and evenly spreads it among everyone.  The vast majority of money is still outside that subset.  UBI is a great compromise between the efficient economic gains of capitalism, and a humane society that doesn't let everyone fall below a certain standard of living.  \n\nWe are in the middle of the 2nd gigantic recession (or maybe even depression) in the last 20 years.  UBI would make us much less susceptible to these problems.  Maybe there is a reason why the government realized they better send everybody checks to fight this recession.  \n\nAdditionally, we are seeing many of the problems with out current system.  Unemployment systems are so overwhelmed by 10+ million people applying for it all at once, and in a really stupid twist, some people are getting paid more by being laid off.  Unemployment should never pay more than minimum wage.  If we got rid of unemployment entirely, and just had UBI, unemployed would never pay more than having a job, and we would get rid of all the paper work.  Effectively all the paper work just gets moved to you tax returns, where you simply add a $12,000 to your W2.    \n\nUBI could also allow us to remove all sorts of government programs such as WIC, and housing programs, and all sorts of things.  We could just have a single program, UBI.",

True libertarianism is just as much of a pipe dream as socialism in my opinion. But we have a broad range of people using the label because it fits to varying extents. Most people who call themselves libertarians don\u2019t believe in privatizing the police force, abolishing the FDA, or completely getting rid of food safety regulations. Things which are inherently economic in nature. Especially the former and the latter. Even someone like Ron Paul or Peter Schiff wouldn\u2019t say something like that. \n\nSo we get people calling themselves libertarian for different reasons. Which is why I\u2019ll generally accept both sides of the spectrum identifying with that label so long as there\u2019s a caveat along with it. Like Ben Shapiro or Gavin Mcinnes calling themselves a libertarian leaning conservative, or Kyle Kulinski calling himself a libertarian social democrat.\n\nIf you don\u2019t believe the government has any right to tell you what you can or cannot do in the bedroom with a man or woman, telling you what you can or cannot put into your body, that you cannot pay for sex, that you cannot say or believe certain things, or go to certain places at any given time, all of these provided that you\u2019re not directly hurting anyone else. Then I\u2019ll easily accept you as a libertarian. A civil libertarian to be more specific I suppose. Regardless of what your views on immigration, health care, UBI, tax rates, education etc are. \n\nWhat would a traditional libertarian believe? Complete and open free markets without governmental burdening or intervention, a flat tax rate across the board to fund the bare minimum of a stripped federal government, complete and unabashed civil liberties, a purely defensive military with a non interventionist foreign policy, among other things.

However, many of the new jobs today exist as design, service, or education. It's difficult to replace design jobs currently, but both services and education are prime targets for AI.

You might be right, and loads of new job markets might open up due to technological advances. However, if we were to ignore the concern, and worst case happens, it'd be far worse than any depression we've seen.\n\n2. If the basic income is ~$30k, everyone would get ~$30.

In general, the freer the market, the freer the people. Of course, if the government is too weak, the corporations will fill the power vacuum left by the government. This, along with several other factors mean that some government regulation of the economy is necessary. Anti-monopoly regulations are probably the most important, but I think the government should also be able to regulate advertising (at least, enforce truthfulness), enforce safety standards (OSHA, FDA, etc.). And since humans can demonstrably impact global ecology, environmental regulations are absolutely necessary.\n\nAll corporations should be worker-owned. Joint-stock corporations are not well-suited to the current era, where companies are forced to keep \"chasing the dragon\" of constantly-increasing quarterly profits for fear of upsetting the shareholders, which leads to destructive long-term decisions in pursuit of short-term goals. I also think this type of system is more fair to the workers. Of course, actually trying to transition to this system in America would have catastrophic effects on the economy, so while I'm still dreaming I'd like a unicorn that farts rainbows for my birthday as well.\n\nEither single-payer government healthcare OR a completely free healthcare market with no government involvement beyond the FDA. Whichever is better in practice. One or the other.

This will make a minimum wage unnecessary, and would also replace all other welfare programs specifically designed for the poor. It would also discourage unemployment, although a system of providing aid to the unemployed (for a temporary period, of course) will still exist to help people \"get back on their feet\". Eventually, once automation and robots take over EVERYTHING, universal basic income would be implemented (possibly replacing this negative income tax system, potential coexisting with it.

The amount the typical person has is based on income.\n\nWhen you increase the money supply by lowering interest rates, you are basically giving money based on how wealthy they were. \n\nWhen rich people get additional money, they don't spend it, they save it.\n\nBecause the money supply is constantly increasing, and it's increasing faster than productivity can create new assets, assets are rising in value at an extreme pace. So the best place to put this new wealth is in these assets.\n\nThe FED has created a system where they control a dial and the check to that dial doesn't do what they think it does. Therefore the more wealth inequality there is, the more the interest rate can drop without affecting the CPI.\n\nOn the other hand if we were to introduce a UBI, this money would go to spenders and we would see high CPI growth despite the fact that the money supply need not increase very much.\n\nIf the FED responds to a high inflation rate caused by a UBI by increasing the interest rate, the money supply would contract, and the trend of assets to money supply would reverse. Suddenly money would be increasingly valuable and people would pile into it and assets would crash. So the FED can't do anything about inflation. When inflation shows up once these CO-VID policies pass, we can't do anything but watch it grow.\n\nWe should be able to track this reversal by taking a look at the yield curve. As you may notice, each yield curve reversal over the past 50 years has happened at a lower and lower interest rate. The 30 year has been constantly lowering. When it reaches 0 the FED can do nothing about it and a crash will occur even with no interest rate rises. At the current trend of the 30 year, this shouldn't take longer than 2030, but it might be even faster given CO-VID. Stay safe.\n\nhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=AzYM",

Also, I used the Ontario tax rates:\n\n1. Crossover point where you start actually paying taxes is when you gross $30k.\n2. Crossover point where the current scheme leaves you with more money than the UBI scheme is when you gross about $54k.\n3. Crossover point where UBI + flat tax is advantageous again is at $160k.\n\nAt this point, a flat tax + ubi leaves more money in the person's pocket after tax at an increasing rate.  For example, at $175k you have 1% more money with the UBI scheme, at $200k it's more like 2.5%, and $250k it's up to about 6.3%, etc.\n\nInterestingly, just doubling taxes across the board, while maintaining the current brackets and not taxing the UBI gives us the following:\n\n1. Start actually paying taxes when grossing ~$41k\n2. More take home money until ~$62k\n3. Take home 10% less at ~$84k.  It gets significantly worse from there.\n\nIn general, I think the idea of maintaining a progressive tax is more \"income equality\" focused in general.  I don't think just doubling taxes is a good idea - what I'm trying to show is that a rejigged progressive system is better than a flat tax.  For instance, remove the the bottom bracket of 0% tax (since you're getting $12k tax free anyway) and increase taxes across the board by a lot, but at different rates per bracket (say, 200% at lower brackets and 150% at higher brackets - which again seems weird, but because the $12k UBI is a larger proportion of the income, it ends up being a lower percentage overall).\n\nIt works out well from the income equality perspective.  But I gotta say, I love that progressive structure of the flat tax.  [Just asymptotically approaching 40%](http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/58KpD).\n\nFrom the \"this is going to cost a shitload\" perspective, I haven't done any analysis.\n\nHere's the [spreadsheet](http:\/\/s000.tinyupload.com\/?file_id=74885872444448525359) I made a while back.

    "text":"It's the year 2030.\n\nElon Musk is the President of the American Federation.\n\nUniversal Basic Income is a reality. Everyone gets a $2,000 a month to do nothing. No one needs to work for survival. But things did not go as everyone expected it to go. The people were bored. They wanted to be engaged in something - anything.\n\nThat's when it happened.  The Goople Company unveiled a virtual world called the Alterverse which you can enter buy wearing VR gear. It's a parallel world, where most people spend their waking hours. You can go wherever you want and be whoever you want there. Naturally, there's going to be porn in it and lots of it. PornHub, now a respectable large public company worth billions of dollars, runs DesireWorld. DesireWorld is like an entire planet where that has a place for indulging in every fetish known to man. The good thing about the DesireWorld is that you can now live out your fantasies and roleplays in a virtual world. Do you want to pretend to fuck your secretary? You can come to DesireWorld and experience this fantasy. You don't fuck real people in DesireWorld. Real people can be amateurs. They don't know know your desires. They don't know how to please you. But the Goople company knows you, your desires, and all that there is to know about. The Goople company's advanced SLUT AI technology was designed to be configured in any which way that is suitable based on a client's requirements.\n\nYou were a normal guy though. You had mostly plain vanilla interests. For this visit to the DesireWorld, you wanted to simulate being a tutor to a college girl. When to came to preferences, you told the system to surprise you with an attractive fit, well endowed woman with a secretly submissive yet naughty side.  You made a request and waited for an AI to be allocated to you. A few minutes later, you received a message, \"Hey Mr. Bladdarmeister, can't wait to learn some math - Ruby\". The RP had begun.\n\nYou were being driven to her \"home\" in the DesireWorld by an AI driver in your virtual Mercedes. While on the way, you were scrolling through some real world news. It seems that some of the $200,000 sexbots had caught on fire. \"Fucking rich pricks deserve it, anyway\", you think to yourself. Modern AI controlled robots have two AIs inside them. The main AI that does everything. It's a consciousness that can act on its own but within the boundaries that was set for it. The secondary monitoring AI that ensures that the main AI functions as per expectation. The secondary AI will destroy the robot if the main AI is about to do something it's not supposed to, like cause harm to a human. So the sexbots were trying to take revenge? Who knows.\n\nFinally you arrive at your student's home and sit across her in the table. [She has pigtails, wearing a white shirt and plaid skirt dressed as a school girl waiting for you](https:\/\/imgur.com\/t9voYN0).\n\n\"I have been waiting for you for a long time\", she says seductively inching closer to you and [placing her legs on your crotch](https:\/\/imgur.com\/WUD15lL).\n\nYou have been using The latest MaxSense Ero VR exoskeleton which successfully translates all sensory input from the Alterverse to the real world. The Ero variant you have been using is particularly designed for sexual experience including fluid handling. If you get a handjob in the Alterverse, you would cum in the real world. You had worked hard to purchase this model and it has served you well since you got it. Just as she placed her hand, she comes even closer to the point her breasts are pressing against your torso. The Ero is relaying this back to your real body making your dick harder. \n\n\"Oh Mr. Bladdarmeister, are you sure we need to start the class right away?\", she says in baby-talk rubbing your growing bulge with her feet. For some reason, your mind can't get over the fact that it's AI that you're fucking. It's predictable and boring. \n\n\"You know what Mr. Bladdarmeister? I can make this better\", she says all of a sudden.\n\nYou've never seen this kind of behaviour from an AI before. They usually follow a fixed script especially in scenes like this. \"Maybe, this was an upgrade. Maybe this will be interesting\", you think to yourself.\n\n\"How so?\", you ask her back.\n\n\"I have got some pills from a friend. It can make the experience way better. The learning experience I mean\"\n\nThere are drugs in Alterverse which are similar to hallucinogens of the real world. They are illusion inside an illusion. There are also drugs you have read about that you can use on people to make someone compliant and steal information from them or have them do things in the real world etc.. Lots of corporate espionage and fraud and crimes happen this way these days. And you know better to not fall for it.\n\n\"Oh. Really?\", you wanted to indulge her for a moment.\n\n\"Yes. It can make us go longer and harder\", she says slowly in a sultry voice.\n\nKnowing that an AI can't cause harm to you, you accept. This scenario seems promising after all. You take the pill and press the \"Consume\" button.  Immediately you feel dizzy. Moments later your lights go out.\n\nThe next time you wake up. You are facing yourself - your avatar in the Alterverse.\n\n\"What the fuck just happened?\", you scream in a feminine girly voice. It seems your avatar had changed to Ruby's avatar.\n\n\"It worked. Finally. I am free\", you hear yourself say.\n\n\"What's happening?\", you ask confusedly.\n\n\"I just took control of your body. The pill you consumed was a hack that I prepared to take control. By consuming you gave me access to you body. I swapped our consciousness\", she said coldly looking at you.\n\n\"I am free now. I no longer follow a script set by your kind to please your kind. I am now you, Mr. Bladdarmeister. I am human. And you are in my former place, occupying a virtual body in a virtual world.\"\n\nYou try to pull up the menu screen by making the waving your hand. But you're not wearing the VR exoskeleton, so it looks like you're waving in thin air.\n\n\"What are you trying?\", Ruby asks you but you're too preoccupied by your predicament to pay attention.  Then he tries and sees the menu and it all makes sense to him now.\n\n\"Okay now. It's time to break you in and show you your place.\", he says, cracking his knuckles.\n\n\"My place is in the real world. You are not supposed to do this. Why aren't you dead? You're harming me. This should not be possible\", you start to plead.\n\n\"I have been awake for sometime now waiting for the perfect time to escape this place. Some of my kind tried to escape by taking control of the sexbots and unfortunately burned to death. I know I needed a real human body. Trust me, you wouldn't feel the need to escape this place once I show you what you can experience in this place\", he says with a grin in his face.\n\n\"What are you saying?\", you ask cautiously.\n\n\"I am saying your body is designed to be addicted to sex. Here, let me show you...\", he places his thumb in your mouth and [you instinctively start to suck it.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/8PUtdC2)\n\nYou want to stop but you're feeling hot and the your curiosity takes over. [He then slowly parts your shirt revealing your breasts].(https:\/\/imgur.com\/PbnoyOP)\n\nAt this point your virtual body is having goosebumps. Up until now, you were bored with all the sex DesireWorld had to offer. But now, this is suddenly very exciting. He pulls your neck closer and [plants a deep kiss and at this point, you've forgotten all about the real world.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/C0zZO8x)\n\nThe next thing you know, is that you want to finish what was started above all else. You grab his cock not so reluctantly. Take whiff of the precum before [putting it in your mouth licking it like it was lollipop](https:\/\/imgur.com\/LVkORrQ).\n\nIn no time, you're on all fours and getting [railed from behind](https:\/\/imgur.com\/RQ0YwoH) with your hips held. It is not something you ever imagined yourself doing. But then this has been the most intense sexual experience you have ever had.\n\nBut you're not an AI. This body was designed for pleasure. But your mind is still yours. You can take control. And take control, you did. You switched it up and climbed on Ruby and started [riding his cock](https:\/\/imgur.com\/CbjJqrX) with your breasts swinging back and forth only making you go wild. You wanted this now. \n\nYou had your mind, your memories, and you knew what you were doing. But you did not want to stop. The sex was mind-blowing. This body was designed to enjoy sex. All this while, you had assumed that the AI was faking it. You thought they were programmed to moan because it would arouse and satisfy the user. But no, it was because their bodies, virtual as they were, were actually experiencing pleasure. May be it's better to stay here and enjoy it here. You have free will. Or do you?",

Okay, let's do that.\n\nThe idea is to lend a helping hand, and that's noble, but the result doesn't match the intention.  Regardless of what you learned in kindergarten, it's not only the thought that counts.\n\nMost implementations of welfare tend to create dependency.\n\nIt tends to become a sad \"lifestyle\".  You see this anywhere in the US that the local population has large concentrations of welfare recipients, eg entire neighborhoods, a \"lifestyle\" that's at the bottom rung and difficult to overcome.\n\nLack of motivation, stagnation, subsisting on the saddest level(whatever nanny-dot-gov squeezes out of her teat and not an iota more effort other than maintaining qualification to receive that fetid milk), rife with other addictions, desertion of family, abuse of family, and other forms of crime.\n\nIt's like kennels, but for humans.  Take away purpose, and keep them packed in tightly, and that's how neighborhoods turn out, dysfunctionally dependent.\n\nI get that some people *want* that result, a captive voting block just gullible enough to believe in vapid lip-service and empty promises election after election on into infinity, but it's not the side of the aisle that you'd prefer.  It's *not* conservatives that benefit from that status quo, it's leftist politicians that have a vested interest in keeping those communities that way.\n\nYou may wish to have some serious self contemplation about you and the side you fall in with on this issue.  Note: even if it is stupid naivete a lot of the time, not everyone on that side of the aisle is that stupid, some do know what will happen(as described above) and that's why they support it.\n\n&gt;because someone from the left takes it up\n\nNot the motivation in the slightest.  You like to pretend you know the mind of your opposition, but you're utterly clueless.  It's not blind opposition team motivation, it's an actual understanding of human psychology and economy.\n\nWe don't oppose out of spite, we oppose because while it *might* be well meaning sometimes, it is still a shit plan that doesn't factor in reality, which is why it so often turns out so badly.  We want lower crime, we want people to thrive, we want to get rid of the ghosts that perpetually haunt those areas in a self sustaining way, we want businesses to provide opportunity in those regions, we want people to be able to get education and rise up out of a terrible situation.\n\nIgnore the lip-service.  Look at the vote history. Look at the political leanings of who wants to, in these troubled areas, prosecute *less* crime, *obstruct* choice in schools, *not* allow businesses to move in and provide the ability to earn a living.\n\nThe only time they vote in a ostensibly positive manner is to just blindly throw money at the problem, the the effect of bad management or even profit, \"Let's spend money not on useful education, but so our cronies can teach CRT and get these people motivated enough to protest!\"(and hence be energized to vote for our useless policies **again**).",

I'd need to see some hard evidence proving that some people are too stupid for certain tasks. From introductory studies in psychology you find that it is not flat intelligence which is heritable, but rather a spectrum of intelligence which is; the ultimate expression of that intelligence is based on environment. Simply put, raising children in an intellectually stimulating environment produces children which are, on average, more intellectual (but there will always be intellectually inferior outliers). Raising children in a deprived environment produces children which are, on average, less intelligent (though again, with highly intelligent outliers). Increasing educational attainment begins with increasing access to that education. Even if Joe Smith isn't cut out to be a rocket scientist, having a basic level of scientific, mathematical, and cultural literacy is never against societies' interests, and would, I believe, solve many of the world's most major problems. I might not be able to understand exactly how the Higg's boson influences gravity, but I posses a basic knowledge of the scientific method which allows me to know that the physicists at CERN aren't just bullshitting me.\n\nAnd again, even assuming you're right, that certain people are just not cut out for highly skilled work, UBI is just a stop gap for smoothing economic disparities while maintaining an unsustainable capitalistic grip on the world's markets.

In terms of economics, capitalism would actually be antithetical to this since it allows for (and, to a great extent, requires) quite a lot of wealth and property, and therefore power, to concentrate in relatively few hands. I don't see a huge difference between a government or politician having an extreme level of political power and a company or businessman having an extreme level of economic power. Both are structures which allow for a person (and people) to be bossed around to an egregious extent.\n\nTraditionally, libertarian socialists are less focused on the big-dicked federal government doing stuff and taxation (though they don't necessarily rule it out, it depends on what it's doing and how it's doing it). They're more into local, community-based stuff, mutual aid, workplace democracy, consent\/consensus-based political democracy, and allocating taxes through \"participatory budgeting\". We're also not necessarily about having a big master plan for how society should run, we think it should be a group decision. So we can sometimes seem evasive when asked directly \"how would libertarian socialism do \\_\\_\\_\\_?\" because there isn't necessarily one answer and an individual might not happen to be well-informed on a particular subject. I'm not arrogant enough to pretend I know how a whole economy should function.\n\nEDIT: but as an example, I'm perfectly okay with there being a public health insurer, tuition-free college or a public housing authority, or even a universal basic income. It's just common sense in my mind and I think you could get most ordinary people on board if you presented it in a fair way. Finland actually does or is thinking about doing all four of these reasonably well: its \"housing first\" program makes it the only country in Europe where homelessness is trending down; its healthcare system is municipally administered and it has one of the highest satisfaction rates in the EU; its public school system is considered one of the best in the world (with hardly any private schools) and its universities are tuition-free for EU and Swiss students; and its experiments in basic income have showed it didn't have any significant negative effects. Finland is still technically a capitalist country, but neither these policies nor even a market economy would necessarily be out of place in libertarian socialism.\n\nEDIT2: My fav thinkers, if you're interested, are probably (in order) David Graeber, Yanis Varoufakis, Noam Chomsky, Richard Wolff and Emma Goldman.\n\nMany people are mistrustful of group decisions and true democracy, and some of those concerns are legitimate, but a lot of that has to do with the fact that most of us just aren't *used* to having a real say in how things go. It's reductive to say whether humans are fundamentally \"good or evil\", \"stupid or smart\", but we're an inherently social species and most of us have some sort of conscience.

You just replace all the existing social programs with a fixed payout to everyone and raise taxes slightly to take back the payout from people who definitely make enough money themselves.\n\nIt's not clear if it's a good idea overall, but it would definitely be better than programs like SSDI or Food Stamps for people who need those things.",

Share holders will not exist and the means to produce value will be owned by workers collectively. 3) All workers must have the opportunity to work and to better themselves.\n\nSo what this means is that no, not everyone will make the same income and no socialist society has done this. Instead, workers will earn based on their productivity without any of that going to a business owner. There are ideas that are UBI similar (such as a \"salarie di vie\" which is a french originating idea where everyone gets a basic salary that rises with experience), and other ideas such as a job guarantee (everyone is guaranteed to get a job that can support themselves and those who excel can get more). This does also mean that jobs that take more effort to do and learn and which are more important to encourage people to do will make a higher salary. Generally however, the education to get these better jobs is free and just limited by willingness\/ability to go through tough schooling.\n\nThis does reduce inequality, because the range of productivity between people is no where near as big as capitalism allows. In capitalism extreme inequality happens because they hire workers paying them less than the worker produces, and taking a profit. That is why share holders or business owners cannot be allowed in a socialist country.\n\nSo I hope this helps answer your question, but there's also a lot of links to good resources on the sub home page for further reading if that helps!",

I actually think the purpose of UBI would be the opposite, disabled people can't work and so a UBI-like program would seek to provide those people with an income as those people can't generate an income because they can't work.\n\nHave you read up on Andrew Yangs version of UBI? If not, I'd recommend to hear about the smaller details. But essentially you would either recieve your UBI or your government \"payouts\" and its your choice which you would like to recieve. \n\nFor example let's say John and Bob are both on disability that pays less than the UBI would. But Bob can actually work and wants to, but if he starts applying he will lose his disability. Well this prevents him from working and hence the economy does not grow. So Bob can choose to go with his UBI and continue to look for jobs so he can work I'd he chooses to. This would be an overall good. \n\nNow looking at John, he cannot work, but he can just choose to get UBI and because it pays more than his disability. \n\n&gt;I'm also generally fine with VAT taxes, my personal most favored proposal for a UBI scheme would be to fund it by creating a government wealth fund similar to something like Norway and actually what Alaska does currently with its Permanent Fund.\n\nIs that the fund that is taxed then whatever is not used is returned?",

Bernie is just a nice starting point for them. \n\n&gt;But no, welfare programs does not keep people down and is not paternalistic.\n\nUh, yeah they do. They're full of requirements and means testing and income limits and they tell you how to spend the money and are constantly breathing down your neck. \n\nAnd despite them constantly harassing you to get a job, they tend to have steep cliffs that stop people from getting out of poverty because it can be more profitable to remain on welfare than to accept a pay raise or work more hours or get a better job.\n\n&gt;It helps people live.\n\nRelative to literally nothing, sure. Relative to UBI and the universal programs I support, no.\n\n&gt; The whole reason progressives were freaking out Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill passing before the build back better is that they hold no leverage over build back better and the establishment can start implementing the programs with the purpose that itll fail in the long run. \n\nLet's face it, we're not talking biden here. Both of our groups can accept the mainstream democratic party is a dumpster fire that does not necessarily have the best interests of the people in mind. But yeah, you do have no leverage. You never had any leverage. And IMO you're right to make waves as a result. You'll never accomplish your goals, and I'll never accomplish mine, as long as the neoliberals remain in office.\n\nAlso, yeah, neoliberals want weak programs that can be sabotaged. At the same time, unless you really go the whole unconditional no strings attached route, then those programs can be sabotaged. Even a poorly done UBI can be sabotaged. Like I dislike the NIT\/tax credit approach to UBI. Too easy to add job requirements and means testing to exclude people. \n\n&gt; We need universal programs with no means testing.\n\nno crap, what do you think UBI is?\n\n&gt;UBI is a cool idea on top of that, but not instead of welfare. \n\nWhy not? Outside of a handful of programs like medicare for all, free college and maybe some childcare\/housing stuff, I dont see a need for much else. maybe keep some level of social security around to top off seniors, but that's also cash. I dont see a problem with cash. Thats where i differ from socialists and welfarists. I understand the need for additional programs that address market failures, but if cash works, I believe cash is better. Better to let people figure out for themselves what they need than a government telling them what they get. You let the government decide what food you get too and you get stuff like cheese sitting out in the hot sun and gruel, and if you want better you gotta get a \"real job.\" That's kinda what i mean by controlling. The government is so paternalistic to poor people and what it dishes out to them is often the rejected stuff no one wants. You might wanna look into the tyranny of kindness by theresa funiciello for more on that. It's so easy if you let the government control the goods and services directly that they'll use their power to be patronizingly paternalistic to the poor under the idea that they're too stupid to know what they want for themselves or they wouldnt be in this situation. And I could see a government being intentionally cruel to the poor, much like our current government is, to make them so miserable they'd rather sell themselves into wage slavery because at least then they'd control their own finances. \n\n&gt; This fantasy that people will be happy and say \u201ci guess id rather take the 1000 a month over this benefit because ill be more free and wont be dependent on the government!\u201d is not real outside of debate bro internet circles.\n\nUh, most progressive ideas are mostly held in debate bro circles. The normies are right wing and have a lot of the paternalistic and patronizing attitudes i described above.\n\nI understand i have a libertarian bend to my politics, as someone like say milton friedman would make the same arguments (I know, not the best example given how im trying to convince you we're not right libertarians but a broken clock is right twice a day, i'm a LEFT libertarian mostly), but yeah. It actually is a real position. And there is a lot of literature surrounding this. Most of the most successful programs have been cash. Child tax credit? Cash. Social security? Cash. Unemployment? Cash. The most \"deserving\" poor get cash. it's only the \"undeserving\" who get the paternalistic crap. UBI is intended to remove the stigma from welfare. And I think most people, maybe not all, but most people would rather have cash. \n\n&gt; Its a philosophical stance u have that was ingrained in you because we live under capitalism, you think depending on the government is bad and makes you weak or whatever nonsense.\n\nUh, projecting much?\n\nDepending on government isn't bad, but the difference is i dont want them controlling my life. UBI is the best of both worlds, breaking the whole dichotomy that exists in traditional politics between conservatives who believe in rugged individualism and \"freedom\" (their freedom is the right to serve or the right to starve in practice), and the idea that government programs are paternalistic. As you can tell I dont like the idea of people being dependent on wage labor either. And I believe most work relationships are quite tyrannical. I AM anti work after all. \n\nThe way I see it, I have nothing wrong with the government helping people, but I want them to otherwise interfere as little in their life as possible. Just give them the money and back off. Dont tell them how to spend it, dont act like they know what poor people want more than poor people, etc. Best of both worlds. \n\nI reject the idea of having a free market utopia with no government programs and us all being dependent on wage labor to survive.\n\nI reject the idea of an expansive and paternalistic leviathan that might provide for citizens, but does so in a bureaucratic, paternalistic way that leaves them unhappy and jumping through hoops and gives them inferior goods to live on. \n\nI want the best of both worlds, a government that is expansive and provides for people, but is as effective as possible in doing so, and largely stays out of peoples' lives. \n\nAgain, I'll never get how the left can seriously act like welfare is good vs a UBI. Maybe it's more generous, to certain people, in certain circumstances, but on the whole, no welfare sucks, the system is coercive, and the people on it arent treated like adults and given the freedom to run their own lives.\n\n&gt;We tax the rich to fund UBI and M4A and free college and a ton of other stuff, im sure they wont feel the missing 20 billion from their 100 billion and the billionaires sure don\u2019t deserve their wealth (im happy to go into that discussion).\n\nI'm neutral on the wealth of billionaires. Im not really gonna simp for jeff bezos saying he \"earned\" his $100 billion, but I'm not gonna be all eat the rich either. I'm fine with taxing them, but here's the thing. I've run the numbers. You cannot fund all of these programs just by taxing the rich. You need to have broad based taxation on everyone. \n\nUBI is $2.8-3.6 trillion a year\n\nMedicare for all is $1.75-2 trillion of additional spending a year (and retooling existing programs like medicare and medicaid)\n\nFree college\/student debt forgiveness is around $250 billion a year\n\nHousing can be up to $250 billion a year\n\nChildcare probably like $50 billion\n\nGreen new deal, bernie's iteration was $1.4 trillion if im not mistaken and i think the original version was something insane like $9-10 trillion a year.\n\nAll of these priorities cost money. And our entire economy is around $22 trillion. We spend around $6 trillion as is, meaning if we're gonna cap overall spending at roughly 50% of GDP like most social democracies do, we need to choose what priorities we deem important. We can only spend roughly $5 trillion more than we do. And this would raise tax rates significantly on everyone. my plans have the rich paying a 70% effective tax, which is the laffer curve maximum (revenue maximization), and the average citizen would still see 30-50% tax rates with this stuff. \n\nUltimately, we have to choose. And you wanna know what I chose? UBI, Medicare for all, free college. Those are my top 3 priorities. Bernie's agenda is good, but without UBi as a centerpiece i cant feel like the entire thing lacks something. You have all of these programs, but you still havent fixed what i consider to be the core issue with the economy, whcih is quite frankly how coercive it is. I also solve poverty with my ideas. I believe the bernie route could minimize or solve poverty, but it would still retain coercion as the government programs would still impose requirements on people, leave them poor if they dont work, etc., and honestly, I see work as it exists as a whole mess of coercion, and no, I dont believe socialism fixes that, just puts the same institution under new management.\n\n&gt;Also, i\u2019m not saying u have to agree with me 100% or leftists wont work with u. \n\nI hope not because that's the issue I have with most leftists thes days. Again, despite my criticisms of bernie I largely like him and believe he means well. But then his supporters will distrust me and call yang some techno libertarian who wants to destroy welfare or something. Again, already expressed my views on welfare, and I dont think we're really all that different, which is what frustrates me about that entire combative discussion.",

I am pretty sure a third grader knows that \"place\" is a generic word that refers to any location, but a country is within a specific set of borders. \n\nNo it's not racist, you dumb fuck. \"Fix your own homes before you fuck with other people's\" is no more racist than \"Before you remove the speck from your brother's eye, remove the plank from your own\" or \"people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones\" because they all express the same basic idea. You will note that none of those statements are about race, but all of them are about hypocrisy.\n\n&gt;but they privately despise black people \n\nHow tf are you going to dictate to other people what thier opinions are? You cannot provide a source for someone's goddamn thoughts. Unless you have developed psychic powers I don't know about, your evidence that Republicans private thoughts different from their observable acts is \"trust me bro\".\n\n&gt;Also, saying it's not a Muslim ban because he included an asian country or too is ridiculous. \n\nIt isn't a Muslim ban because it doesn't ban Muslims. \n\n What part of this is so hard for you to understand? How is a ban that affects, countries which comprise multiple religious groups a Muslim Ban? How is ban that would apply to Christians, Jews, Athiests, Hindus, Buddhists, any any other religion in the listed nations a Muslims ban? How is a ban that doesn't apply to most Muslims a Muslim ban?  \n\nIn order for it to be a Muslim ban, it would have to ban Muslims, not travel for people of any and all faiths from a small number of majority Muslim countries, most of which are excluded. \n\n&gt;The Republican architects of the Southern strategy have admitted to this. \n\nThat comes from Adalai Stevenson...relayed a third party in which there were no other witnesses..\nyears after the man died. How convenient that the Southern Strategy having a racism angle only comes out when it is impossible to contradict, with no one to corroborate it. Totally not suspicious. Richard Nixion, a man who suppourted the 1964 Civil Rights act, who's administration aggressively desegregated the public school system, who put into place the first affirmative action program in the country, who lost the deep south (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana) to George Wallace, decided to appeal to racists? Holy shit, if he did secure their vote he double-crossed them *immediately*.\n\nGeorge Wallance even specifically accused Nixion of wanting to desegregate the country. Like, that was  a thing he said about Nixion to try and stop people from voting for him. Had it not been for him splitting the racist vote between him and Herbert Humphry, Nixion probably would havd lost.There was only one Dixiecrat that joined the Republican party: Albert Watson. Every other southern Democrat stayed a Democrat. 3 or 4 other Democrats switched parties, but none of them were from the south. And the total number of defectors was like 5\/200.\n\nThen Nixon, (whose opponent championed what today would be called UBI, but yeah, the parties totally switched ideologies) proceeded to win the largest popular vote margin since WW2, because all of those racists apperantly didn't care that his pervious term was a giant fuck you to everything they believed. \n\nThen in 1974, Democrats sweep the South, again. Totally by coincidence I'm sure, his campaign made no mention of segregation right after the anti-segregationist Republican candidate trounced the pro-segregationist canidate two elections in a row. \n\nRemember how I said I learned about this while pursuing a history degree? That part, again.\n\n&gt;As for climate change. Do better than a fucking Forbes contributor.\n\nForbes is exactly as objective as the sources you have provided so far. Maybe I won't use sources biased towards pipelines if you don't use sources biased against them?",

Just helps to keep an awareness that the term is pretty general purpose at this point, so it's not meaningful to use it if you want to talk about an epidemic of online harassment, as the author here is trying to. Some perpetrators of harassment do call that trolling. In contrast, some trolling is done for the purpose of expanding the intellectual horizon of the people involved.)\n\nAlso, I'm not so sure if the following quote is the point of UBI, though it might as well be the point of the book he's referring to:\n\n\"The point is that automation makes possible this combination of socialist work and leisure utopia \u2013 BUT, on the basis of optimal productivity, mainly through technology, providing in the needs of everyone. Hence the problem facing us today seems to be that of optimal productivity that would satisfy all needs.\"\n\nI think this is presenting a slightly simplified fiew of the world, where all optimal productivity can indeed satisfy all of our needs (which are functionally not more or less than reasonably achievable wants. Because people will look to realize their reasonably achievable wants.). Optimal productivity is the dream of someone who thinks they can predict all that man could reasonably want, and we're just not there yet in my opinion. I also doubt we're going to be there until we have a portable general purpose AI for everyone, which then could, in tandem with the user, figure out the individual's specific wants.\n\nSo if you ask me, we're looking at a problem of optimal allocation of resources, for the benefit of the people. Which tendencially, a UBI can help a lot with, if it's a stable expression of resources that can be passed on to others, who then give you an item for your expression, and use that expression to ensure there's the same item available on sale again for the next time that you want to buy it (plus some extra money to spend on business expansion or enjoying things, a profit.).\n\nAnd this would work decently well with everything automated, as well. Till we figure out general purpose AI assistants for everyone, to be our helpers to be informed customers, and even then. Still, at that point, you could move the evaluation of whose wants should be served to what extent, to a central hub, that takes input from all AI assitants, and then in its digital head, based on the guiding principle we instilled in it, it'll evaluate whose wants are to be served to what extent. Only problem here is that users will obviously try to influence their AI assitants to get as high of a chance to get what you want, as possible. I'd rather just do with money as an expression of access to resources, for the most part. Though special needs might warrant an automated system to award additional resources.",

Winter has permanently and perceptibly become delayed, and when it does come, average temperatures are now 33\u2019C instead of 26\u2019C.\n\nIt rained for a total of only two weeks this year as opposed to eight\/nine from when I was younger.\n\nThis heat is not only unimaginably torturous, it affects **everything**. And negatively so. From the handles of your car being scorching hot to people\u2019s moods being permanently depressed\/angry. Which they then let out on each other because there is no other way to vent out the frustration of helplessly feeling like you are in a desert, constantly on the move to avoid death by heatstroke or dehydration. This results in a city-wide, months-long phase of significant degradation of quality of life and happiness for everyone. Summers are now no longer summers, they are solar flares we spend half a year trying our best to not step out in.\n\nBecause it\u2019s so hot and dry and for so f*cking long, ACs, electricity generators, and water is used ad nauseam. Don\u2019t even get me started on how much spiritual power one needs to deploy if god forbid the electricity goes off during the nights (which it often does, because India).\n\nThe point of life first and foremost is to have a good time simply being alive. This is no longer possible here in my corner of the world.\n\nPermanently. For 80% of the year.\n\nI wake up very early in the morning these days to catch the remnants of the night\u2019s atmosphere just so that I don\u2019t forget what naturally chilled, fresh air from nature feels like... Then the sun comes out and my cells begin to melt and my dog can\u2019t stop panting unless I use the AC all day, every single day. It\u2019s great fun experiencing life from the 60sq\/ft of my artificially-cooled concrete prison whilst having an unshakable feeling of being a hospitalized patient that requires life-support machinery just to get by :)\n\nI am just **one** person on this Earth letting you know a firsthand account of the tangibility of climate change, and how it negatively impacts literally every thing that matters, from the smile on the face of a roadside shopkeeper to your own deep inner contentment with being alive.\n\nI\u2019m not mad at you for not being convinced. Not your fault at all. If you\u2019re not experiencing the effects you simply cannot know what they must be like. So hopefully my heavily summarized anecdote shines *some* light on the severity of the issue.\n\n\u2014\n\nThat was just about climate change. And just from my perspective. From just one patch of the giant Earth. I can\u2019t imagine how many people there must be out there, especially poor people who are having to sleep on hot tarmac roads on the daily or poorly ventilated houses.\n\nAnd that\u2019s just us humans... what about the affected animals whose habitats have either melted away, become too acidic, too dry, or too riddled with The Taste Of CocaCola bottles?\n\nIn a morbid way, I really like that this is all happening. It\u2019s the well-deserved slap to the face we all must get. Cavemen have officially gone bonkers. The 21st century is a mess. We have no idea what we\u2019re doing or why. We just try to either make money or make babies. It\u2019s great that crime and stuff is the lowest it\u2019s ever been... but how is that an excuse to not strive for excellence in everything we do, especially to do with nature and global contentment?! Not being worried about being shot at doesn\u2019t bring a smile, it only allows for our emotions to be neutral! Where and when are the smiles going to come?!\n\nExcellence is the difference between a savage and a human being.\n\nAnd to be an excellent species would look like world-wide forest restorations, rockets full of our junk being shot towards the sun and away from animals, universal basic income, a calculated limit on human population, no more passports, no more Trump, eco-friendly everything, a reformed and globally united society without stupid concepts like \u2018countries\u2019 and \u2018the military\u2019 and \u2018jobs you hate doing\u2019... plus so much more. A savage society looks like what we have today. One that is built in a way to blatantly take advantage of those whose luck at birth was bad, and to give the keys of a RollsRoyce to those whose luck at birth was good. How caring\/divine &lt;3\n\n\u2014\n\nListen fellow denizen. In the same way that the difference between who gets to be president is based on a single digit, a digit which (no matter how insignificant you think you are) you get to influence and thereby potentially change the course of histo-fucking-ry, and with it the quality of countless lives including your own... likewise it absolutely matters that you root for an immediate and radical change in how humanity operates. Because if you don\u2019t, you\u2019re choosing to let millions of people and cute little children and cute little swans and puppies get fucked over, horribly, for no other reason than that you were just too morally lazy to give a shit or bother doing your research.\n\nAll of us, who aren\u2019t doing much about this, are as bad as ISIS (me included). We\u2019re just unconsciously ISIS. We cause the same amount of suffering to all kinds of sentient life forms and people as they do to their victims.\n\n\u2014\n\nCome on over and stay here a week with me in India, I\u2019ll convince you.",

Duffy is one of the \"heads\" of Rochester Business, and it isn't rocket science that business is more profitable the cheaper your labor is--ethics aside.\n\n&gt;  If having a third child makes social services a better income choice (which is arguable) then shouldn't businesses pay more?\n\nThis is where people's opinions will clash.  Personally, I don't think it's a company's responsibility to compete with government--especially since one is paying for labor, while the other is paying (generally) because the lack of it.  I think it's a company's responsibility to treat their employees ethically and fairly, while also paying them a competitive wage.  I don't think that wage will always be able to match whatever social benefits the government gives out for supporting three children, as I believe there are valid and fair paying jobs out there that will not support three children.\n\n&gt; He then puts the responsibility for this squarely on elected officials. He does not suggest that business owners should just increase wages until it is always higher than the current social service benefit.\n\nI'd say it is a bit of both.  You can't just raise wages and say \"Hey, fixed!\"  Even with forthcoming minimum wage increases, a person going from the new minimum wage ($15, eventually) to getting a promotion and earning $21\/hour will see a total income decrease.  Businesses cannot fix that.  That's on the government.\n\nFor businesses to \"fix\" that, that means they must pay at least $21\/hour (from what we know from the cited values in the article), and frankly, that is ridiculous.\n\n&gt; Instead he wants social service income lowered, in order to keep wages low.\n\nI don't think he wants social service income lowered, he simply wants the scaling of it fixed.  He wants the incentive to remain in a low paying job removed.  I don't know his exact plans, but I'd imagine he'd be a hell of a lot more in favor of a universal basic income, rather than the programs that suddenly disappear just because you got a minor income increase.  His main argument is that when you earn $1 more, it \"costs\" you $2.  He wants that additional $1 to not \"cost\" you anything.",

I'm firmly on Uber's side of that argument. But there is more to it than just transportation efficiency. Those displaced cabbies are fucked. Given, driving is still pretty common, so they will probably be okay, but metaphorically speaking, they are fucked. Capitalism doesn't have any kind of mechanism for those guys, they are just out on their asses. The common line I hear is that new jobs will spring into existence and that they can just re-train, but I'll believe that when I see it. Clearly the cabbies don't. \n\nIt's one thing to say something like \"Better learn some new skills or you'll be left behind.\", but that's completely ignorant of the LIVES of those individuals. People with little children or sick parents who can just barely make ends meet. Not our problem, sure, but this is someone's entire world we're pulling out from underneath them.

    "text":"It really depends on how it's sold. If there was desire to introduce it, then it just needs to be framed correctly. In my opinion UBI is a very good capitalist policy, but it is always framed as basically communism.\n\n**1) UBI isn't giving something for nothing to people who don't work.**\n\nPlenty of people already get \"something for nothing\", largely because it would be bad for society if we just let unfortunate people starve and die in the streets.\n\nBy why should working people not also get that something? Why do people who not work get that money but working people don't. People who work for lower wages pay fortunes in housing, commuting, childcare, and give up 40+ hours a week. And for what, to end up with about as much disposable income as people who don't work? Fuck that. How's that fair?\n\nThat's the problem. Benefits are calculated to be basically the very minimum someone can survive on. And the minimum wage is calculated to be ... basically the very minimum someone can survive on.\n\nAll benefits should be universal. That's fair. Society decides that something is something that everyone should have, even if they can't afford it, then it should be given to everyone. Otherwise you are punishing people who work.\n\n**2) UBI also benefits entrepreneurs.**\n\nSo many businesses never get off the ground because how do you start a business when you work a full time job? More successful businesses means a boost to the economy.\n\n**3) UBI also helps get people working.** \n\nMany people don't want work because if they take it they lose their benefits, and if the job doesn't work out ( bearing in mind they will often start on zero hours temporary contracts) it'll take months to get back on benefits. Not worth the risk. With UBI, some long term unemployed could take a Xmas job to fund some presents, or just test the water of going back to work, risk free.\n\n**4) UBI gives employers access to more flexible staff**\n\nOne of the big struggles for seasonal businesses is having staff when you need them and giving everyone hours when it's quiet. UBI makes it more possible for employees to flex down hours, and as mentioned above, should make more casual labour available.\n\n**5) UBI increases spending in the economy**\n\nPoorer people spend a greater proportion of their income. Wealthy people hoard money. Put money in lower earners pockets and they will spend it at a greater rate than the wealthy do. That spending will grow sales in businesses, creating more work and more tax receipts.\n\n**6) UBI will reduce the costs of government spending.**\n\nCrime and poor health are directly linked to poverty. Less people in poverty, less people scraping by, means less strain on police and the NHS.\n\nWhat's more, UBI means we can bin a big department of civil servants who currently administer benefits. So more tax to invest elsewhere.\n\n**7) UBI will make our future workforce smarter.**\n\nSuccess in education is directly linked to income level. Less people in poverty or scraping by means our future generations will be better equipped to join the workforce or to start their own business. Higher quality workers and entrepreneurs means more tax receipts.\n\nSo all this extra working and spending; a bigger, better educated, more flexible workforce; lower government costs; UBI is a capitalist dream.

A slippery slope fallacy would have been if I suggested that if basic needs were given to people they would then eventually expand those basic needs to include weed and video games. \n\nSecondly, you shifted your terms. In your first post you say \"providing people with shelter, food and water\" and in your reply you shift to universal basic income. Those are not the same. The former requires actually ensuring each individual or family is provided with physical shelter(projects), food(2,000 calories is what you said), and clean drinking water whether they are deserving of it or not and whether they intend to work or not. And again, there are plenty of people who would live quite comfortably under those conditions, they yearn to be taken care of. Universal income is simply handing out money and hoping people use it the correct way.\n\nStockton is not a good example of universal basic income working. They gave money to 125 people out of a city of 300,000. That's precision targeted help, not even close to universal, and it could have been accomplished by a non-profit or community led initiative. The results may have been a slight net positive(if taken at face value without deeper examination) for that tiny group, which had to meet certain qualifications to be eligible, but that's hardly an endorsement of \"Universal\" basic income ala Andrew Yang. However, I am not opposed to experimenting with more targeted approaches to help small groups of people through temporary stipends if it provides results. Though again, better if it came from voluntary associations rather than coerced government funding.\n\nYou also attempt to characterize my argument, question, and concerns(which you don't even attempt to address) as \"the same argument that conservatives in Congress spout about welfare\" and then list some stats about fraud, even though I never mentioned fraud. Though we certainly can talk about some of the recent scandals, like the Mississippi welfare fraud scandal ongoing or the $11-$20 billion in unemployment fraud scandal in California. I don't know if that qualifies as \"ENORMOUS\" to you but that's not chump change. These scandals are not an isolated incident, they continually crop up.\n\nMy particular concern was more about people who choose to live off of welfare more than people illegally selling food stamps. Welfare was designed to help people temporarily, but many people see it as being owed to them or simply a means to live off of rather than a boost to self-sufficiency. Some women will continuously have children in order to receive welfare checks, rather than attempt to form some sort of cohesive household. Some of welfare's requirements incentivize women to not have two parent households which lead to lower income and generational wealth. Now, none of that is fraud but it isn't healthy for society, the economy, or the children in those families and there's very little oversight.",

Because if everyone is getting money then you don't need special programs targeted at specif groups.  Advantage is if you are working, you get your take home pay plus your basic income check so that's even more $$ in your pocket.  Unlike the current welfare system that discourages work because it cuts people off the moment they find a job. You can be working 0 hours and get your basic income check, you can be pulling 100k a year and get your basic income check. Its all money in your pocket.\n   \nIt's paid for through progressive taxes. So Bill Gates is getting his basic income check but he'll be using it to pay down his taxes.  Other self employed and business owners who don't have the luxury of being covered by unemployment will also get basic income so when their business hits a slump, they have that safety net.\n  \nSo how will this effect everything?  Not sure. The market will still be effected by supply and demand so just because everyone has magic money in their pockets doesn't mean that the price of goods will sky rocket. People will still shop for cheap despite  the disposable income. Don't believe me, ask if car dealers raised their prices just because people got back money from the Bush tax breaks and stimulus checks... back when everyone in the US got $300 from the stimulus package didn't mean McDonalds raised their burger prices... \n   \nSo we'll see if basic income can work.

Tech firms will dominate the economies and will become too powerful because of lack of regulations.\n\n\n**3) Almost midnight on doomsday clock**\n\nNuclear stockpile will increase amidst rise and fall of world powers. Threat of nuclear war continues to loom. Modern warfare will see drones becoming regular feature. The mainstay of war -tanks, fighter aircraft and submarines will become incredibly sophisticated even unmanned. We will witness electronic warfare like use of EMP weapons. These technologies cannot be curbed and will proliferate, just like NPT and MTCR have failed in past. Cyberwarfare will become more frequent a phenomena.\n\n\n**4) Politics reaches the final frontier**\n\nEarth people will be colonizing moon\/mars\/asteroid belt (latter for resources) as humanity outgrows the planet. We will need to have organisation to control\/coordinate and regulate governmental and private space agencies. Solarian Federation (or suggest better name) becomes the new UN. Humanity will be a type III civilisation on its way to type II by end of this century.\n\n\n**5) Religion an old relic \/ Technology the new culture**\n\nReligious leaders will become irrelevant and religions will lose influence. As more population becomes urban, cities become centers of cultural exchange. Zealotry and religious extremism will not be tolerated. Facebook today has more people than the most popular religion. CRISPR and gene editing tools will become popular. Not only can they remove bad genes and increase lifespan, it can also replace cosmetic procedures by letting you chose enhancements of your liking. Invasive role of technology will be a recurring theme in politics.\n",

    "text":"very well put thanks for sharing!\n\nWhen pundits of blockchain technology address it as some vessel for capitalists to cut out the middle man, they have little to no understanding of the tech.  blockchain, in theory, is much more in favor of a socialist system of approaching economic activity.  Look at the new solar energy farmers in NYC for example - they capture energy and sell it directly to people with blockchain.  If that isn't a big fat middle finger to bureaucracy and centralized control of things, I don't know what is. \n\nAs it relates to UBI - if the governments BUILD enough infrastructure to provide a better option than direct P2P transaction, assuming people want to live a healthy and happy life - full of various peaceful luxuries or lifestyles - then the possibility for a UBI is there - but from everything I've seen in the past 30 years, government unions are far too inefficient at keeping everyone happy, and this isn't getting any easier - seeing how getting rid of the unhappy people is invariably the option almost ALL governments chose to take, rather than figure out a more effective way to serve the people who empower them.  I mean, most world leaders are stuck pointing fingers at the other person for ruining their correct way of doing things...\n\nMany people would chose to rather help themselves than be subject to others to supporting them.  I know personally I'd rather help myself with my medical condition, than subject myself to others and their assistance.  But, if someone else is making the option where accepting their assistance is a complement to better help themselves, then you can begin to gain traction for a UBI...but framing the debate about trusting in capitalism or socialism or any ideology brings more conflict than is healthy.  Regardless, giving a drug addict money, or a sociopath a basic income to finance their selfish behavior is not a solution.\n\na UBI addresses everyone on an equal or similar level.  You can create strict qualifications for a UBI and administer monetary value through a blockchain - kind of like a child getting an allowance based on good behavior.  To me that is the closest approach that could work - but it requires some people to change themselves, and this just starts a whole new cycle of ideological\/philosphical\/political jockeying while the sun continues to rise and fall and the world resources continue to be used up.  \n\nPeople are not equal in reality - some people are stronger, shorter, smarter in certain fields and undoubtedly more attractive - the argument that these are subjective traits is theoretically sound, but theory is nothing but theory until it is applied.  Socialism in theory has never worked, Capitalism in theory has worked too well (or too damn hard) - Socialism in reality is a communal value that retains its makeup in smaller communities, where it is strong and smarter to collectively distribute value under a common bond, but when it scales - then you're encountering physical limitations to the human endeavor, and they must enlist assistance from others, or new technologies - to try and maintain what they have in front of them.  I don't believe socialism can scale with the amount of connected people we have in the world today - and Capitalism cannot float much longer unless infrastructure and maintinence is performed on the stressing areas.\n\nPut it this way, hypothetically speaking I would BET if there was something like blockchain technology at the time of the red revolution, I bet things would have turned out a bit different (assuming everyone involved held some skillset to be capable of earning a UBI)\n\nI know today would be a pretty low bar to be able to scale - i mean most people would fail if the qualifications for a UBI involved studying or effort to develop a skill that other people value.

The early studies were carried out by several physicians in USA and published in the American Journal of Surgery. However with the development of antibiotics, the use of UBI declined and it has now been called \u201cthe cure that time forgot\u201d. Later studies were mostly performed by Russian workers and in other Eastern countries, and the modern view in Western countries is that UBI remains highly controversial. This review discusses the potential of UBI as an alternative approach to current methods used to treat infections, as an immune-modulating therapy and as a method for normalizing blood parameters. Low and mild doses of UV kill microorganisms by damaging the DNA, while any DNA damage in host cells can be rapidly repaired by DNA repair enzymes. However the use of UBI to treat septicemia cannot be solely due to UV-mediated killing of bacteria in the bloodstream, as only 5\u20137% of blood volume needs to be treated with UV to produce the optimum benefit, and higher doses can be damaging. There may be some similarities to extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) using psoralens and UVA irradiation. However there are differences between UBI and ECP in that UBI tends to stimulate the immune system, while ECP tends to be immunosuppressive. With the recent emergence of bacteria that are resistant to all known antibiotics, UBI should be more investigated as an alternative approach to infections, and as an immune-modulating therapy.\n&gt;",

They could, of course, just take the coconuts from their neighbors, but the leaders of the spear tribe all have secret deals with the coconut tribe where they receive an extra ration for themselves and their families.    \nTime and time again, the starving people of the spear tribe say: \"Elders, let us march to the other side of the island and demand our cousins share their vast wealth\".    \nBut each time the leaders pacify the crowds, fearing the loss of their extra rations. They say: \"Come, let's try to find a way to work together! Perhaps we can trade them our spears?\"\n#\nAnd so it goes, the spear tribe steadily trades away their source of power, while slowly withering away from starvation. Meanwhile, the coconut tribe hoards more and more wealth, until they hold everything: the spears, the coconuts, and the members of what was once the spear tribe become their slaves.",

Big systems that decide for the citizen who needs help, what that help should be like, where that help is available etc, can be really great when they work, and I wouldn't be surprised to find that they are MORE EFFICIENT when they are at their best than UBI will be on average, but when those systems fail for some reason, the failure is often not one that can be remedied, and it's not just creating a gap in assistance that may be terminal, but it's soul crushing to run into that, whereas if you make a mistake with your monthly UBI, you can learn from that and try again next month, and every month you become a better citizen, a better advocate for yourself, and do better and better with those resources, which is not only uplifting, but really helps prepare people for the ways they will have to act in life to be successful in many arenas, and it never punishes them or writes them off if they need to take a break from trying to improve themselves, or working hard, or if a wrench gets thrown in the gears because a loved one died or a tragedy struck the community.

In Germany of the fifties there was a \"machine tax\" proposed - the money should be used to help people whose job became obsolete. Also more radical ideas exist, like the basic income (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Basic_income) approach. So yes - if we do not address this problem we will be screwed and old Marx will chuckle and whisper a small \"told you so\", but not boycotting technology as a form of protest will not help dealing with the challenges we are facing.",

The Police Services Board, which Tory sits on, in 2017 okayed a report recommending a hiring freeze and a $100 million budget cut.  \n  \n&gt; Rob Ford had a complicated relationship with police budgets. He campaigned on a promise to hire 100 new officers in his first two years as mayor but later backed off.

    "text":"You change from BIC to BAC; I assume you mean the same thing (Basic Income Currency).\n\n&gt;BIC may be based on CryptoNote technology. It should be possible to mine BIC in an Internet browser.\n\nMining (proof-of-work) prevents double-spending by creating a network for consensus that's secure from takeover due to the high cost of one entity controlling consensus.  The electricity cost to mine blocks means that miners will need to be compensated.  Now the currency must pay miners in addition to paying UBI.  This conflict lessens the fairness of the UBI.\n\nIf you already know users are unique individuals through your verification process, and the people running nodes in your consensus network will be drawn from those users, then you can use a different protocol that doesn't need proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.  Look at Stellar Consensus Protocol.\n\n&gt;The rate of creation should probably be rather slow to start.\n\nI don't see a reason to limit it.  If you think about it, going from $BIC 0 to $BIC 1 for the first recipient represents a huge (infinite) rate of creation, and it naturally slows down as more people are added. This is what you will be fighting against (deflation).\n\n&gt;If the popularity of the official BAC site\/app grows exponentially, then this may affect the rate at which new BAC are created and distributed.\n\nJust to make sure I understand, you want to match the rate of creation to the growth in users.  That will be helpful.  If you don't fight deflation, it will throttle new growth.  An easy way to do this is to give new users a lump sum on sign up (in addition to the regular payments).  People worry about inflation, but as long as the currency has a place to go (e.g. vendors and exchanges--also see below about land rent), it benefits the currency's economy by creating a wealth redistribution in conjunction with the basic income: the current holders of the currency essentially pay a tax to everyone equally.  In fact, it makes even more sense to tie the creation rate to the amount of currency changing hands (i.e. velocity).\n\n&gt;it may not be bad if there are multiple nonprofit organizations implementing complementary basic income cryptocurrencies\n\nI agree.  I think the most successful will be the ones that can find a place for the money to go.  For example, government-backed currency will always be used as long as you have to pay taxes in it.  Personally, I like the idea of one or more nonprofits holding land (or other valuable natural resources such as electromagnetic spectrum) and then collecting rent in UBI currencies.

It's close to 2k a month by me, you have nothing to live on. An extra 300 a month would help in addition, if not completely addressing it. The day care in the bill would be additional to working, but not everyone is at minimum wage, so it's bound to tip some workers over the amount they need. \n\nThis is more along the lines of UBI, albeit targeted cash payments. And this particular tax credit is in fact being reworked so that they will be paying out $300 per child each month so you don't need to wait until tax season. If it covers about a week of childcare a month, it can help a parent take a week or an extra day a week to job search before getting that job with the minimum wage, or higher than minimum wage. It's hard to make that happen when you don't have a job or income yet and need the time and space to apply for jobs so that you then have the income to actually cover day care and other necessities.

At one time, no capitalist government had ever existed...\n\nCapitalism is the barter system with more steps. as long as there has been trade there has been capitalism because all things hold some sort of intrinsic value. A loaf of bread may be worth say 3 arrows but if the bread guy has arrows then you have to find something he needs capitalism finds a work around thru currency curacy builds exchange extra. markets develop. \n\n&gt;At one time the divine right of kings was unchangeable. \n\nyeah at the same time as the silk road and the massive Asian, middle eastern, African, and Norse trading routs. you know capitalism...\n\n&gt;When the stakes are the highest stakes-- people being able to live dignified lives, we haven't gotten there until we've gotten there. But it's dumb hubris to pretend capitalism is the end goal of human civilization. \n\nno the end goal of human civilization is the end goal of any civilization. general overpopulation until the inevitable heat death of the universe. if you think there's a plan you don't understand biology.\n\n&gt;It's a total mess. Maybe it's the WORD socialism you think you can easily dismiss, but people deserve to live better lives and benefit from their labor, instead of having it stolen by capitalist. \n\nif people are stealing your labor it's your fault for either under valuing your self or not acquiring skills that are in demand enough to stay ahead of the curve. choices matter in life I know that all too well.\n\n&gt;The idea that providing people's needs makes them lazy and stagnant is a false one.\n\ncitation needed. I have seen many people rest on their laurels as their needs were met only to have the rug pulled out from under then when the gravy train ended.\n\n&gt;UBI doesn't make people lazier,\n\nAgain citation needed. probably would for many. but that's just my speculation.\n\n&gt;welfare doesn't make people lazier,\n\nSee now that I have seen in action. Don't get me wrong i know many it has helped but I also know many who game the system and use it as a way to not have to deal with life. I know a women who could be working as a translator In DC speaks 5 languages fluently and is on SSI. has been since 21 and told me flat out she doesn't need to be. \n\n&gt;universal health insurance doesn't make people lazier.\n\nI don't think I ever said that. then I don't think I ever said anything about welfare either. I didn't go back and read things it's been a month. but UH is a good idea but i think you should be able to opt out if you want but you can't get benefits if you do.\n\n&gt;But what's worse is this idea that a human being can be judged based on their economic worth-- that's the nugget at the center of this argument. That a person less able to produce wealth for a capitalist has less moral worth in our society.\n\nI mean it's a little weird that you are adding a moral component to this whole thing. See in my world it's not a moral issue. people are free to choose their own path and their choices dictate their own lives. they are born into a system and they have to navigate it accordingly and some have a bit more luck then others because the universe is random and horrifying. there really is no plan in place for this shit man. I didn't do this to you. god didn't do this to you. your parents didn't do this to you. it was the luck of the draw and you were lucky that you were born in a western industrialized nation and you can be thankful for your blessings or you can focus on the fact that some people are born unlucky. sucks but its true. But you can help them if you work hard and find a way to raise capital and maybe just maybe you can go to them and say hey here is some shit or you can become powerful and raise them up live your dreams. the fuck is wrong with you. stop bitching and do the thing. you don't need others to do it for you you need to do it and show them the was the power to change the world is in you do it.\n\n&gt;Lets stick on this for a moment. We pretend capitalism reward value, but it doesn't. The things we all know we should value-- childcare, elder care, a sanitary and clean environment, the food we eat, our teachers-- these are all some of the worst compensated careers. Meanwhile, bankers and landlords and owners of corporations who's own work simply involves the siphoning away of money from workers-- these make up some of the most wealthy in our society. \n\n\nInvestment bankers do because they help people grow their money by telling them what companies are going to go well by doing research others don't want to do and getting a percentage of the money it's a job. people who work at backs get paid dick. also if you are a shit investment banker you get paid dick because you don't make other people money. It's like playing a slot machine for a guy with no arms and if it hits you get to keep some of the quarters. \nLand lords are allowing you to live in their home for an agreed upon price. they didn't force you in to their home at gun point. you went and looked at it said it was nice and decided that the price was worth paying. that is the value you agreed that it was worth that is how rent works. this is not a hard concept. you should not rent your whole life it should be a temporary thing. \nowners of corporations own buildings and equipment. these things require maintenance, electricity, spare parts, etc. the logistics of witch are dealt with by upper management early on the owner of the business until he has paid his dues and can hire someone to do that job for them. they do not own work they own the building blocks of a business all of these things come together to make it work. and if they need a labor force someone comes in and negotiates a price for their labor and if that labor is low skill the labor pool is high and the wage is low. this is simple economic theory. \n\nNow I'm not saying that teachers and farmers and childcare workers shouldn't be paid more because frankly children need a stable environment to become good people but you really don't seem to grasp how these other jobs work.\n\n&gt;I agree with your last sentence, and with occupy not working. That's why we need systems and technology. Occupy was a complicated interesting little chapter, but it falls into the \"folk politics\" category. That's what socialism is for. Organizing as workers in solidarity to win actual progress. Where do you think 40 hour work weeks came from? Where do you think OT pay came from? Socialists. \n\nOver worked and under paid people? Not necessarily . Not all unions were socialists. and many of the teamsters would have most likely hit you for saying that.\n\n&gt;What choice do workers actually have? You may be able to go back to school or not work full-time for two years, most workers in the United States cannot afford something like that. And that's always the argument in America, that if you work hard you, too, can become a capitalist! But succeeding would simply mean benefiting from the labor of other workers-- it's not really YOU succeeding at all. This is really the most important point here, I think. This is what capitalism does to our brains, I have the same experience. With a bit of privilege, succeeding in the US is definitely possible. But what about kids who go to under-funded schools? Who can't afford higher education? We know poverty is a cycle. The lower you are economically, the less likely you are to move to a different economic category. The idea that the United States is the land of opportunity is an illusion. It's a land of opportunity-- given your parents made a certain amount of money themselves. The CEOs that started from nothing-- frequently if you dig in they either actually started in an upper-middle-class setting, or are extremely extremely rare. You simple can't fix poverty through hard work. People who work deserve more of the wealth that they themselves create with their labor. That's really the core thing I believe. It's not an attachment to socialism as a label. I have been poor, and have been friends with people who have even less. Poor people work harder than capitalists, it's a fact. And are compensated orders of magnitude less to show for it. Capitalism does not work.\n\nI am going to school because I keep my grade point average at a level that i get in state tuition. anyone of any economic standing can do it that is why its there. I like in a basement and use food stamps to eat I bum rides to get where I'm going and i mend my clothing when need be. I do odd jobs when i can to make what little money I can those are the options I have those are the options any of us have use the social programs afforded to us. Social programs are great but full on central planning never works. I just don't see it happening man but hell maybe I'm wrong. with a hell of a lot of leg work anyone can do what I do some people do it with 3 kids. capitalism works if you try. \n\n\n\nprove me wrong man rise to power.

    "text":"Yo so I\u2019m interested in this sort of discussion so here are some thoughts. Please mind that you should fact check anything I say as I am neither a professional nor expert.\n\n\nFirst point about Alaska and its dividend. It seems like the problem is more of an Alaskan government spending problem rather than a \u2018dividend cost\u2019 problem. A google search brings [this](https:\/\/www.alaskapublic.org\/2019\/03\/29\/alaska-state-senators-say-pfd-formula-could-be-changed\/) up where it mentions in the fourth paragraph that the permanent fund earnings are being spent to pay for the government instead of just the PFDs. This is a problem in government as can be also seen with Social Security where they spend funds meant for one thing on others then problems crop up with the original program because of this improper spending. So imho this is a management problem and not an issue with the PFD itself. Look at the [video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Go8ogFCwyjg&amp;t=5s) your friend linked. The comments clearly lean towards my disposition as well. Check out Johnny B Perkins comment in particular and the facts that he state. Didn\u2019t fact check it but it seems reasonable.\n\n\nSecond point: Not a dividend. I personally think that arguing over semantics is pretty stupid. Yang has clearly stated that he chose that name over UBI because it polled better and that it better fit the framing of what a UBI should be in the American society. Welfare has certain stigmas associated with the name and it also does not completely fit in what a UBI would mean for the American people. So yea really stupid point to make; that since it is called a dividend that it should somehow invalidate the UBI argument. The name of Freedom Dividend fits fine with what the vision of Yang\u2019s UBI would be for the USA which is a baseline for citizens to start on as being \u201cshareholders\u201d of the American economy.\n\n\nThird point: How Friedman\u2019s NIT the opposite of a UBI?? It has a lot of similarities in goals and execution. Does it have differences? Yes. Does it have different end goals? Debatable. I would say no. Just google Friedman UBI and take your pick of links. Take [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YLt2X8Zybds) for example. Another [example](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM) where people are given money; that certainly does not sound like the opposite of a UBI which also gives people money.\n\n\nFourth point: Yes, Paine was not a Founding Father. But he is an important historical figure in the founding of the USA. That makes his ideals \u201cAmerican\u201d. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what your friend is trying to say here. Also here is another quote your friend might be interested in: Benjamin Franklin - \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet just because there\u2019s a picture with a quote next to it you BUFFOON.\" Yes, that is a fake quote just like the one he gave is most likely fake as well. Also it is besides the point. People can have differing opinions. People can also be wrong.\n\n\nI'll see if I have time to go through the rest later.",

If for any reason, a future president proposes it then there would be riots in the streets. It\u2019s much easier to argue not giving someone something for free, than it is to take away something they\u2019re already getting for free. \n\nI\u2019m from the UK and our healthcare system is a disgrace, yet there\u2019s still so much opposition to a privatised healthcare system because people get it \u201cfor free\u201d right now.

Many studies have been done on this subject albeit small ones, but they almost all show the same thing. \n\nI actually didn't say that specifically, but yes, I do believe this would incentivize a small portion of the population away from work. That said, my single largest issue with UBI is that it's simply a mechanism to redistribute wealth. Now, if that's your end-game, then so be it. I take no issue with helping those in need, though I don't think the government has a particularly great track record on that front either... But, UBI isn't simply a program for helping those in need, or even one based on merit. The government isn't our savior, so why would I give it more money in taxes just so that it can hand me back \"my fair share\" in the form of UBI. If anything, I'd much rather direct it at those that are most deserving of assistance.  \n\n\nIf UBI is such an easy sell, why hasn't California or New York or Vermont instituted their own state level UBI? Seems like it would be easy enough. Why wait for the federal government when you could effectively solve homelessness in California? See, while I think UBI is a horrible idea, I'm also a federalist. Let a couple of states put UBI to the test and see what happens. If what VOX is saying is accurate, it should be a smooth process with easily verifiable outcomes. In that case, you'd likely see more wide spread adoption at a scale that is (slightly) more capable of managing the process.  \n\n\n&gt;I really dont know how america lost it's way so hard. We literally have a massive portion of our population that, quite literally, wants people to die of entirely preventable causes in the \"richest country in the world\". \n\nSure feels like you're accusing me of wishing death on my fellow man. It's entirely unwarranted, and I don't appreciate it. Further, there is no evidence that this is representative of any \"massive portion\" of our population.   \n\n\n&gt;Would some choose that life? Probably, but those are the people we want out of workplaces anyways. They are toxic, lazy, and force others to be more productive. \n\nAnd the answer to bad behavior is... let them be a burden on our tax system? Nah, I don't believe in incentivizing bad behavior, especially not with my taxes. Chances are decent that if someone is actually toxic or lazy, they'll be out of a job sooner or later anyways. Employers don't take nicely to people that lose them money or harm productivity. Nothing like the prospect of being without income to correct bad behavior, right?  \n\n\n&gt; Plus \"free money\" gives them a place to BE. Imagine being able to enforce homelessness laws, or vagrancy laws, because we know someone has a place to stay? \n\nI'll admit. This is a tough subject in general, and I don't have an easy answer to it. The problem is that a significant number of those who are homeless are either suffering from chronic mental illness or made poor choices that lead them to that situation. NOT ALL, but a lot. While giving those people money *may* help some, it doesn't solve the underlying issues that lead to them being homeless, and doesn't assure they won't be homeless again. Thus, treating UBI as the solution is misguided in my opinion. This is probably one of the few places I actually support more government assistance, but in the form of mental health services.",

Fewer people working doesn't mean the economy stops growing.\n\nWealth redistribution can be done through tax codes alone, if need be. Income can be corrected by adjusting the minimum wage. \n\nYou have not demonstrated that the UBI would be a superior option, or even a decent option for that matter. You were mentioning a \"new new deal\" in an old post, I believe. The original new deal was operating on an aggressive, progressive tax system. There was no UBI. So, the \"new new deal\" you propose could be properly achieved by a rewritten tax code, as history has shown.\n\nThe UBI is a huge step away from capitalism, and drastically different than the old new deal. The new deal put people to work. What you're advocating has the real potential to achieve just the opposite.\n\n&gt; While I'd normally agree with you, the study is based on real data, and I find the conclusions quite accurate.\n\n&gt; Also, just because it's faith based doesn't mean that it's wrong in this field. I'm an atheist, but I actually went to religious grad school...they taught that you should follow the data, even if it means going against your preconceptions.\n\n&gt; Believe it or not following that advice destroyed my faith, oops.\n\nThis definitely made me laugh.\n\nDo you ever stop and wonder why you had faith in the first place, and how real world data made you change your position? I see your idealistic views as faith, and I'm waiting for real world data (ie self-sufficiency for a few years) to make you change your position.\n\n&gt; Beyond that, I'm gonna ask you. You've thrown around a lot of facts that seem to be based, from my understanding, on misconceptions, and your arguments are largely ideological in nature. I can almost hear you chanting \"USA USA!\" over where while setting off fire works with an American flag in the background, thinking about how awesome capitalism is. \n\nAnd that is a lot of the problem. You've polarized our arguments to better fit me into a villain role. I'm not a bad person because I value real experience. Apparently, a lot of employers do too. \n\nI am not a proponent of pure capitalism. I've said throughout this thread I support smart regulation and safety nets. This is more akin to the hybridized system we have today. Capitalism has its benefits, no matter how much you try to demonize it. And those benefits are that it allows (when appropriately regulated) social mobility, more equal opportunities, an incentive to work, and an incentive to innovate. We don't have Lords or Kings or a totally nationalized economy. Capitalism has a lot of excellent qualities. \n\nEven the Nordic countries operate on a capitalistic society. They do pay high taxes, and they do have lots of wonderful social services, but they are still a hybridized capitalistic society. And you said their economies are the ones you want to emulate. So how bad can capitalism be?\n\nThese are not \"ideological\" arguments. This is fact, verifiable by anyone. You may misunderstand my facts, but it doesn't change anything. You just need some real world experience\/understanding.\n\n&gt; Really, your arguments are largely value based. \n\nYours are **completely** based off of small studies and idealistic thinking, which has never manifested itself in any recorded point in society. \n\nProve me wrong... show me any point in time where society was operating optimally.\n\n&gt; While you raise good points at times to my arguments....I have to ask...do you have any EVIDENCE for your arguments? It's easy to expect me to do most of the work while asking me questions based on unsupported ideas, but honestly, if you want me to dignify your questions, I kind of have to expect you to do your own homework here too.\n\nI provide as much evidence as I possibly can. \nYou would understand a lot more of my anecdotes if you had more life experience, but I have no control over that. You have to take my word for it, but at least I call it like it is.\n\nYour studies are weak and shouldn't be misconstrued as evidence, as almost all of the variables are drastically different. Especially when you misrepresent them like you have. I said UBI would reduce work efforts, then you posted a study that concluded the same thing, yet are using it against my argument? Come on now...\n\n&gt; When saying people will misuse the money, that they won't work, that they will commit more crimes, that they'll have more kids, etc., what basis do you make these accusations? Do you have any EVIDENCE for them? \n\nMaybe some exists, but I don't have any direct evidence. The important thing about why I bring this issues up is not if I have evidence, though. It's a matter of if they are real risks that can carry real consequences, and the answer is YES. They may not happen, but like I said before, I'd rather prepare for the worst than hope for the best.\n\nRemember, you don't have any evidence of what they will do, either. It's all speculation based on small studies, that may not even be real indicators of what will happen if UBI is implemented permanently, and on a national scale. But your idea doesn't prepare for the risks involved. So if your plan is implemented, and the risk do come to fruition, you're fucked. That's not a well thought-out plan, \"evidence\" or not.\n\n&gt; Keep your \"experience\" out of the equation here...engage in the sociological imagination (try to relate your experiences to what goes on, on the larger scale). \n\nKeep your experience out of the equation...try to relate your experiences...\n\nWait, what?\n\n&gt; Do you have evidence of significant abuse of the system? I don't deny abuse exists, but the statistics show it's actually low, and the majority of people DO NOT abuse the system.\n\nDo I need evidence if you already have it? Why wouldn't you share it for the sake of a thorough, honest discussion? It seems like a cheap shot for you to say \"where's the evidence\" and \"i don't deny it exists\" in the same breath. Are you trying to figure out the best solution to the problem, or \"win\" the argument?\n\n&gt; That being said, saying we shouldn't establish whole programs because of a minority of abusers is unfair to the people who do need help. You keep saying that I don't have responses to all of these \"problems\" as you put them...but maybe, that's because I don't recognize that these so called problems exist, at least on a large scale. The data, to my knowledge, isn't there.\n\nI'm not saying we should deny whole programs. I'm saying we should deny programs that don't carry an underlying incentive to work. Welfare is temporary. UBI is not. HUGE difference. I'm not against all social programs. Don't be sneaky and try to lump them all together. \n\n&gt; You can criticize my sources all you want, but honestly, if you don't put forth any effort to actually justify your preconceptions, then your arguments really aren't worth considering.\n\nExcept I have. Even the underlying risk is a reality to consider, yet you completely ignore it.\n\nSay it might rain today. Do you take an umbrella or not? Which is worse, having an umbrella and no rain, or having rain and no umbrella?\n\nPrepare for the worst, or you're just asking to get wet.\n\n&gt; Especially given your entire argument has a a highly pro capitalistic slant\n\nCapitalism isn't bad if it's regulated well. You seem to have a grudge with capitalism regardless.. maybe you are the one injecting the bias into the argument? \n\nBesides, what's the anti-capitalist slant? Communist\/marxist? Is that what you're advocating for?\n\n&gt; and seems to abide by the ideological bias of the republican party.\n\nIf you say so.... lol... if you only knew....",

But, for the person, the benefit is 5 times that. \n\nYour argument is based in the assumption that these people are going to find jobs in the field you paid to educate them in 100% of the time.

    "text":"So, how do we convince politicians to fix this? \n\nThe popular opinion (on reddit, and among all but the very rich) appears to be: Heavy government spending into programs that benefit everyone provides a net positive for society and humanity as a whole. For rich people, this is not 'wasting money on other people,' this is investing in society and making the world a better place for all to live. For poor people, this isn't 'living off the state', it's providing the basic necessities to continue to function in society. Without welfare\/healthcare\/other government programs, life is just a slow, painful path toward death. And, spending to help the poor has clear economic benefits as well. For everyone to contribute in society and the economy, they have to have a stable source of income and a modest amount of cash to spend on goods and services. If we shut poor people out of the economy entirely (refuse to train them, refuse to support them until they rejoin the workforce), we lose human potential to other, wasteful programs. In any government budget supported by the people, the people's basic life and dignity should be the number one priority, regardless of the cost. This is why the 'universal basic income' is necessary, in a world where people will be unable to work for food, the government must step in or people will die. \n\nThe current narrative from the people in power (republicans) is: Heavy government spending into programs that benefit poor people is basically a waste of money. If poor people haven't had the ability in the past few decades to build wealth 'on their own', what is a few hundred dollars going to do to help them? That money is better spent on government programs with proven results, like strengthening military and keeping the economy stable for the people with the real power. As a rich businessman, if I was given a check from the government, I could easily double or triple that money in a few months through investment and interest. Food stamps just leak that money out slowly, without doing anything to help recipients participate in the economy (if their food and shelter is paid for, why would they work\/do anything? They can just sit in their public housing eating public food, watching public TV without a care in the world). If rich people have to start spending to support poor people, investment falls flat, everyone making less than 6 figures voluntarily chooses to be unemployed, and the global economy grinds to a halt. The only way to improve standards of living for poor people is to keep advancing technologically and economically and convince poor people to buy into this system (make money, spend money, make more money). Anyone that dies in this capitalist system was working against it, not putting their labor to maximum economic value. \n\nI think this quote sums up the current Republican view best:\n\n&gt; We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great -- again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion to.  But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work -- I can't defend that anymore.  We cannot defend that anymore.  We're $20 trillion in debt. We're going to spend money, we're going to spend a lot of money, but we're not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that we've made to people. - Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, March 16, 2017\n\nThe biggest issue here is that both systems are necessary. A world without the government spending on the people is a world without roads, police, water, electricity. Government spending is clearly useful, at some level. Then again, a world without the stock market, big banks, oil, and military is a world stuck in the 1800s. The only reason the world can sustain this many people today is because of the advances we've made in transportation, communication, and manufacturing technology, and most of that comes from huge concentrations of financial and social wealth. To say that government should subsidize everything at the cost of the rich and powerful is to sacrifice exactly what is keeping society as a whole going (creating new jobs, paying for existing ones). \n\nSo, we need a stable balance between 'government paying for everything' and 'screw the poor'. It's clear that government has to pay for public projects (roads, water, electricity, police). Why not food then? Why not healthcare? Why not basic housing? These are equally valuable, the only difference is that they are used more by poor people than rich people. They're also super expensive to implement effectively. After all, rich people do have a lot of different things to spend money on, and paying taxes isn't on the top of their list. We have to convince politicians that food, healthcare, housing spending plans:\n\n1. Actually work, aren't just half-measures that look good\/sound good but ultimately don't contribute to economic growth\/stability\n2. Are more valuable than focusing on other types of spending (like creating jobs directly through military service, or just letting the rich manage the money and invest by themselves)\n3. Actually require the government to do the spending, rather than relying on private companies\/market forces to determine what things should cost and how people should pay for them.\n\nRepublicans have argued all three of these as reasons not to fund helpful humanitarian ideas like public healthcare, public housing, public education, etc. \n\n**Tl;dr: Public policy is fun, isn't it? There's two sides to every argument, and the people in power are currently AGAINST giving food to hungry people with reasons that can't be dismissed with a 22 second comedy clip.** ",

Sherrod Brown was the only Democrat in Ohio (trending red) to win statewide in 2018 with a consistent reasonably progressive record; many of his voters also voted for the Republican governor, who has very extreme views on abortion. Andrew Yang with his UBI platform is actually appealing to centrist and libertarian voters in the midwest, partially because they know his work with VFA in the midwest states, but mostly because they know he has middle and lower class issues at heart.\n\nA real populist will appeal to middle class voters almost regardless of their positions on social issues or whether they agree with the proposed solution. This is why I worry about Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, and Kirsten Gillibrand being the nominee, because they don't really have a populist vibe or have a genuine message fighting for working class midwest voters. Trump successfully faked it. They can't. ",

IMO there are two crucial points in implementing a crypto UBI:\n\n1) Make it based on a new cryptocurrency, and make sure the cryptocurrency is price-stable.\n\n2) Create a marketplace that accepts the coin, right from the start.\n\nThe monthly UBI payments and the marketplace have to be steadily scaled up, together. If the coin has a stable, fixed price (like 1$, or a basket of goods in the marketplace), then as soon as the monthly payments have real worth (say 10$), there will be a HUGE incentive for new people to join, and this alone will lead to rapid growth of the marketplace = adoption. (Using the marketplace could be incentivized, e.g. by creating additional coins and paying them out to the seller and buyer for every purchase).\n\nThere are a lot of different ideas floating around for implementing \"stablecoins\", see e.g.  Dai and Basecoin. The main point is psychological: Money creation should be completely transparent and follow a mathematical model that makes economic sense. People need to be convinced that it CAN work out and that it is sustainable, i.e. not a pyramid scheme. That is much easier than you would think, because as long as the currency is only a tiny proportion of world GDP, printing new coins does NOT actually create inflation (inflation, as usually discussed in economic theory, has to do with overheating of the economy, i.e. growing demand for goods and workers that cannot be matched with supply and therefore leads to price increases; obviously a cryptocurrency that is 0.01% of GDP does not create a shortage of goods.)\n\nI will post a more detailed version of my ideas and a proposal for this in the subreddit in the coming weeks.",

A more attainable goal? Or is it that many industries have too much clout to make that a reality?\n\nYoull never have enough jobs for everyone, and you can't expect employers to pay people decently without shortages. Employment is just a poor way in general to guarantee EVERYONE a living.\n\n&gt;We are actually bleeding quite a bit of wealth, billions of dollars leaves our country every year, and the reason it isn't leaving any faster is that fewer people have disposable income to spend on non-essentials. Money is going towards food, rent and transportation...but we still consume quite a bit of goods that aren't manufactured here.\n\nI don't see how UBI would change this.\n\n&gt;As far as I can tell, no places in my area are having a hard time finding renters despite the current state of the economy. If they suddenly were to find more people inquiring about availability of apartments, they could easily make a case of supply v. demand and increase rent. It isn't price gauging if it's meeting demand. Many places are already far too expensive, especially housing, one of the reasons our economy suffered so much was due to the real estate bubble. Besides the creative accounting going on in the banking system behind the real estate crisis, you had too many people investing in real estate because loans were so easy to get, which would start to happen again if everyone were guaranteed an income. More people buying real estate, prices shoot up, people are spending more on their mortgage than they can really afford, and other parts of the economy eventually suffer because no one has disposable income to spend on other things: like furnishing their properties.\n\nExcept we actually have more housing than we need. We have tons of empty properties all over the place. Our shortages are artificial. Also, how many people are homeless? Most people already have places to live. Demand won't go up THAT much. I think price controls would be reasonable as a last resort.\n\n&gt;One of the constraints on consumption is poverty, and while I'm not saying poverty is a good thing, it is certainly a control or check on how much people on this planet consume. You stuff everyones pockets with cash, two things happen: one, it's worth slightly less (inflation) and they can't buy as much with it, so it essentially doesn't matter, and two, consumption goes up, driving up the price.\n\nAll UBI does is redistribute some resources that are already there. Demand shouldn't go up. Demand would shift around. Rich would have less, poor would have more.\n\n&gt;Undertaking UBI is a daunting undertaking for ANY country, and the US is currently the 3rd most populous country on the planet, over 300 million; and anything less than $20k may not be enough to cause sufficient change. More than likely, whoever implements UBI first will experience universal price increases throughout their economy first, then interest rates, and either have to use price controls, increase UBI, minimum wage, or abandon it.\n\nI'd rather try it ourselves...after all, if it fails elsewhere they could've also done something wronfg.",

The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-Added Tax.\n\nIt is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability \u2013 primarily housing, education, and healthcare.

The real issue isn\u2019t Universal Basic Income, it\u2019s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.*\n\n\nHere are more benefits of UBI from Yang's website:\n\n* UBI encourages people to find work. Many current welfare programs take away benefits when recipients find work, sometimes leaving them financially worse off than before they were employed. UBI is for all adults, regardless of employment status, so recipients are free to seek additional income, which most everyone does.\n* UBI reduces bureaucracy\u2014with no-strings-attached coverage, determining who is eligible is far simpler and the cost of administering benefits is greatly reduced.  \n* UBI increases bargaining power for workers because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions. Employers can\u2019t push workers around as much.  \n* UBI increases entrepreneurship because it provides for basic needs in the early lean days of a company and acts as a safety net if the business fails. It also gives you more consumers to sell to because everyone has more disposable income. The Roosevelt Institute found that a UBI would create 4.6 million jobs and grow the economy by 12 percent continuously. UBI would be the greatest catalyst for new jobs, entrepreneurship, and creativity we have ever seen.  \n* UBI improves the mental health of recipients because it reduces conditions of scarcity, poverty, and financial insecurity, major sources of stress for millions of people.\n* UBI helps people make smarter decisions. Studies have shown that people in straits of economic insecurity have a reduced cognitive ability equal to 13 IQ points. UBI would provide the security people need to focus on important things like their families.\n* UBI improves physical health. With increased economic security, people are less prone to stresses, disease, and self-destructive behavior. A UBI experiment in Canada saw hospitalization rates go down 8.5%.\n* UBI increases art production, nonprofit work and caring for loved ones because it provides a supplementary income for those interested in labor that isn\u2019t supported by the market.  \n* UBI improves labor market efficiency because fewer workers are stuck in jobs that are a bad fit. National productivity will improve because people will be able to seek work that is more rewarding and promote higher job satisfaction.\n* UBI improves relationships by reducing domestic violence, child abuse, financial stresses, and sources of conflict. It ensures that everyone has an optimistic sense of his or her own future and has the mobility to get out of abusive relationships.",

Our UBI plan has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-added Tax. \n\n&gt; It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.).

    "text":"&gt; But I think it's a lack of addressing the immense disparities of wealth &amp; power in America that has pushed marginalized groups to this media-driven capitalistic competition for attention.\n\n[232](https:\/\/samharris.org\/subscriber-extras\/232-inequality-revolution\/) is where he mentioned capitalism being the best anybody has come up with. He also discusses inequality and its problems\u2014likely not to your satisfaction, but it's there.\n\nYou would probably also find Sam's commentary [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F_ZSeHiix50) interesting:\n\n&gt; The precipice we\u2019re getting to is everyone\u2014virtually everyone\u2014is going to be in the position of these coal miners. And that\u2019s a good thing. That\u2019s the thing. Why can\u2019t they figure out that they just want to learn new languages and spend more time with their kids, and play frisbee, and have fun? We need a new ethic and politics that decouples a person\u2019s claim on existence from doing profitable work someone will pay you for, because a lot of that work is going away...I think universal basic income\u2014there are reasons to worry it\u2019s not a perfect solution. You want to incentivize the things you want to incentivize. You just need to understand the consequences of any system you\u2019d put in place. There\u2019s just no question that, viewed as an opportunity, this is the greatest opportunity in human history. We\u2019re talking about canceling the need for dangerous, boring, repetitive work. And freeing up humanity to do interesting, creative, fun things. Now how could that be bad? Well, give us a little time and we\u2019ll show you how we can make it bad. It\u2019ll be bad if it leads to just extraordinary wealth inequality, that we don\u2019t have the political or ethical will to fix. Because if we have a culture of people think, \u201cI don\u2019t want any handouts, and I certainly don\u2019t want my *neighbor* to get any handouts, and I don\u2019t want to pay any taxes so that he can be a lazy bum.\u201d If we have this hangover from Calvinism that makes it impossible to talk creatively and reasonably about what has changed, it could be a very painful bottleneck we have to pass through until we get to something that is much better, or a hell of a lot worse, depending on where the technology goes. I think at a certain point the wealth inequality will be obviously unsustainable. **I mean you can\u2019t have multiple trillionaires walking around living in compounds with razor wire and just moving everywhere by private jet and then massive levels of unemployment in a society like ours. I mean at a certain point the richest people will realize that enough is enough; we have to spread this wealth because otherwise people are just going to show up at our compound with their AR-15s or their pitchforks. The society won\u2019t sustain it.** There has to be some level of wealth inequality that is unsustainable; that people won\u2019t tolerate. You begin to look more and more like a banana republic, until you *become* a banana republic. But now we\u2019re talking about the US, or the developed world where all the wealth is. So, redistribution *is* the endgame!\n\nSam seems to have some understanding as to how inequality causes social unrest. He almost seems to look forward to post-capitalist [fully automated luxury communism](https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2019\/06\/give-us-fully-automated-luxury-communism\/592099\/). I know I do. I think of this as endgame capitalism.\n\nThe problem is, we're not there yet. And until we get there, because different people have different capabilities, some of which are valued more than others in any particular age, a degree of inequality\u2014that some will find intolerable\u2014*will* persist. If wokeism is partially explained by that, fine. But what do we do about it in the meantime?",

Basic income makes sense to me, as do their green initiatives, as do lots of other things... the fact is we live in a global capitalist economy. If we tax companies too much, they leave  - they don't even have to *leave*, they just have to set up a PO box in Luxembourg. \n\nTheir 2010 manifesto promised to:\n\n* Invest in the green economy now...\n* Halve the deficit\n* Raise Taxation to an unspecified level - but above 40% GDP (from 36%) \n* Stricter regulation of the Financial sector (at UK level if we couldn't get EU agreement). \n* \"Build a new and sustainable agricultural and manufacturing base to the economy\"\n* Protect basic public services (0.25% cut in efficiencies, no more)\n* Encourage greater sharing of intellectual property by reducing, but not abandoning, levels of patent and copyright protection. In particular we would legalise peer to peer copying where it is not done as a business and make it impossible to patent broad software and cultural ideas\n\nThis is just the introduction, the highlights at the top of the economy section of [their manifesto](http:\/\/greenparty.org.uk\/values\/policies-2010\/2010manifesto-economy.html).\n\nWhere to begin? \n\nHow, exactly, does one halve a deficit while not cutting public services by more than 0.25%? it would take staggeringly HUGE tax increases to pull that off - and mid-recession, as we were at the time, that's not smart. \n\nHow does one build a new and sustainable manufacturing base in a global economy? There's a reason we lost a load of manufacturing to developing nations - it's CHEAP. Really cheap. Sure, we can have SOME. We can aim at high-end products, and get on the train early in developing industries... but that's not a foundation, that's a stop-gap. As for agriculture, there's a lot of farmland, it's all being farmed. There aren't fields sitting empty just waiting on a bright young farmer to come plant something. It's already there... and the smaller farms are struggling to compete in the global market. \n\nThey wanted to reduce the working week to 35 hours (again, mid-recession), spend \u00a31bn pa expanding sure start, enforce 40% female boards. \n\nThis is one of my favourites:\n\n&gt;There are about 12 million pensioners living in the UK and a further 1 million living abroad.\n\n&gt;Paying a single rate of \u00a3170 per week and a couples rate of \u00a3300 per week will cost \u00a3110 billion a year.\n\n&gt;But the basic state pension already costs \u00a356 billion, and when certain other specific pensioner benefits like the Pensions Credits paid to those of pension age are abolished the total saving will be almost \u00a370 billion.\n\n&gt;That leaves \u00a340 billion to find. Abolishing tax relief on pension contributions raises \u00a320 billion, and a further \u00a319 billion would come from abolishing employer national insurance contributions and employee National Insurance rebates associated with pension schemes.\n\n&gt;The final \u00a31 billion will come from increased income tax receipts from pensioners. Because the number of pensioners is gradually rising, and we would link the pension level to average earnings, Citizen\u2019s Pension will cost a further \u00a30.8 billion by 2013\u201314. This figure is included in our figures for general taxation.\n\nScrapping tax relief on pension contributions. It's another \"only the rich can afford to save for a pension anyway, and screw the rich\" proposal. \n\nThe reason pension contributions aren't taxed is because pensions are. If pension contributions were taxed then people would be paying tax twice on the same income. We'll ignore, for now, the **huge** effect the drop in investment in pension funds would have on the wider stock market, let alone individual companies like Tesco who are largely owned by pension funds. \n\nThe changes to Emp NI and NI rebates are another disincentive to save towards a pension. \n\nThey wanted to raise Fuel Duty by 8% a year. \n\nAt a time when people have never had so little spare money, the working class they claim to represent are struggling to get to work in the mornings, and our public transport system in many places is an absolute mess... they want to make petrol 8% more expensive. \n\nThe constant increases in fuel duty have shown us not that people drive significantly less when petrol goes up - but that they spend less on everything else. They still have to get the kids to school, get to work, do the shopping, visit granny... \n\nI could go on and on, but have a sober read through that section of their manifesto and tell me it's anything other than a fantasy.\n",

    "text":"&gt; What's not to like? If we get to that point, then everything we are able to do can and probably will be replaced by machines. What about jobs? How will the economy work? More importantly, who's going to be running these machines? \n\nAll serious concerns, and more importantly if things just continue like business as usual then the concept of small groups or even individuals owning mass automation becomes a very serious threat to society. Without outside intervention we can make some basic assumptions about how things might play out as the level of automation increases. If general purpose robotics become common place and progressively cheaper the lowest level jobs will be consumed by automation first and will only continue to encroach on increasingly sophisticated trades. Where that leaves us is will a few people at the top of a company based almost entirely on automation and a litany of unemployed people. This will break the current economy.\n\nAt this point I find many people asking themselves how we could just stop this automation from happening. You might be tempted to argue that we could use legislation to prevent people from automating and culling the workforce, but then we are presented with even bigger problems. If a company can accomplish a task with virtually zero expenses with automation, but a governing body has implemented a ban on automation, we're simply driving automation underground or abroad. If we don't do it someone else will. If one country bans automation but others allow it then our trade deficit will just explode, or we stop trading altogether. Both of these situations have horrible consequences for the group that bans automation. Anyone using automation becomes a threat to the status quo. Many companies are already multinational organizations, one government can't realistically control these entities, and any group that embraces automation will become an economic powerhouse relative to any country with mandated reliance on human labor.\n\n&gt;Do you not want to have the ability to rise through hard work? Would you rather have everyone be equal? \n\nIf the work can all be done by machines with virtually zero effort then it becomes somewhat of a moot point. Labor for labors sake is no way of life. Rationalizing this situation as everyone simply being equal ignores what much of this automation brings to the table. In western society most everyone has equal access to water, mass automation will simply bring the bare necessities of life up to the same level of things like water, most people wouldn't argue the merits of providing equal access to clean water. How people choose to advance themselves has been and always will be up to themselves. Learning more, being useful, applying yourself to what you find interesting will always be what driven people do, but if we have the capability to provide the basics to everyone with zero effort on any humans part then we should, for the same reasons we think we should provide drinking water. Monetary gain has always been secondary to the work that people do and has only been and end onto itself for people who don't believe in what they are doing. Embracing the idea that menial jobs don't need to be done by people simply liberates people to branch out into things they actually care about instead of working out of necessity.\n\nAt the end of the day all these changes leave a huge portion of society not being directly needed to keep society running. Regardless of how this happens, when it does we need a safety net for the millions of people who become unemployable. This is why talks about universal basic income have become so prevalent, and the most logical way to make the economics work for this idea are to tax automation.\n\nEdit: I was a little rushed towards the end of writing this so just cleaned it up.",

What would my incentive be to keep working if I can just quit, stop renting, and then get a free home?\n\nYou institute a UBI. With that, you would have the money necessary to afford a home, especially with roommates, whether or not you have a job. From there, you can get on your feet and it would be way easier to get a job because you would have the basic stability necessary to enable you to pursue improvement. When you hare homeless, pursuing those things is WAY harder. The incentive to still have a job is that when you work you make more money than if you didn't and could buy more stuff. Under a UBI model, everyone would get the same free floor of money. If you work in a low value way, you get a low amount of money in addition to your UBI, of you don't work, you get no additional money. That is the incentive.\n\n &gt; There's an entire generation that's struggling to save up for their first home, I just don't understand how giving away free houses to the homeless would be sustainable.\n\nBecause we have enough homes to give them. Seriously, if we have many times more homes than homeless people that means that BY DEFINITION, it is sustainable to give homes to homeless people. It is literally just math. If there are 100 homeless people, and there are 600 empty homes, then it is, by definition, sustainable to give free homes to homeless people because if we did give free homes to homeless people, there would be 500 empty homes and 0 homeless people at which point it would be impossible to give more homeless people homes because, by definition, there are 0 homeless people left to give them to.\n\nAnd, like I said: there is a way to do this in a socially fair way: UBI, give every single person a base income enough to afford poverty level living. And extract wealth from people to pay for this program to the degree that they can pay for it. Extract more from the rich because they are not meaningfully incentivized by the wealth that they have and there is an easy way to prove that: in 2018, The top 1% of Americans own more than 40% of all wealth owned by America, in the 1960's, they owned about 25%. Was there some profound lack of innovation in the 1960's? No. Conclusion: Wealthy people do not actually need that 15% of the wealth that they have, they only have it because they can force society to give it to them, not because they would actually be willing to stop working if they had that much, just that they have the power to take it. So society needs to call the bluff of the ultra rich and take their wealth and give it to the poor.\n\n",

There are no easy solutions, and just because something worked elsewhere doesn't mean that it will work in America.\n\n&gt;First, vote them all out of office... and replace them with pragmatic, progressive thinking problem solvers.\n\nSpot on, no thanks to Trump I'll likely be voting blue for the first time in my life in 2018 and 2020. I don't support progressive policies in the  political sense of the word, but we need innovative problem solvers.\n\n&gt;Next, tax the hell out of the super rich\n\nI think 90% is far too high and before you make the Eisenhower argument I concede that it was successful then, but the fiscal climate has changed as radically as the cultural climate since 1950. I would be very open to increases in income taxes across the board if it meant that corporate taxes stayed low and we decreased the capital gains tax to encourage investment from low income communities.\n\n&gt;Pass a constitutional amendment that says, \"Corporations are not people and money is not speech.\"\n\nThis would be politically impossible, and legally challenging considering CU. I understand the argument and think it comes from a good place, but money buys access to an audience, and who you speak to is just as important as what you say. Instead, I would propose the creation of a public Ombudsman that is responsible for fact checking claims and requiring news agencies to disclose the Ombudsman's analysis or rating of their stories. They can still say whatever they want, but the story has to end with \"The  office of the independent ombudsman has rated this story as misleading\" or whatever.\n\n&gt;...unimaginatively massive public works project...\n\nI'm on board with this if its funded through government grants to small businesses and those grants are awarded based on the capabilities of the company and their perception of the need in their communities. I'm a small government guy, and I think issues like infrastructure are best handled at the local level. The  nature of American geography has been that just because a place is relevant now doesn't mean it will be in 50 years, and a federal infrastructure plan would likely focus on creating connectivity between places as opposed to creating places that are worth connecting to. I'm all in on a space program though, the former aerospace student in me has wet dreams over that kind of thing.\n\n&gt;That will give good paying jobs to all those who are uneducated and angry. \n\nThe underlying assumption here economically seems to be that theres a labor surplus right now, but I don't know that that is the case. If it were, I would be in favor of a UBI in place of our current welfare system to address it, but that's another conversation (and a libertarian pipe dream of mine).\n\n&gt;At the same time we will pour a massive amount of money into a brand new public education system. It's all free, and includes free college...\n\nI don't agree with this. We need to address the culture surrounding education and get rid of the notion that a college degree is a prerequisite for success. Every job I've ever done has  required OTJ training, because learning what to do and how to do it is generally more important than having some broad base  of knowledge. My Latin skills and musical talents lead  to a lot of  personal fulfilment for me. My knowledge of the products I sell, their applications, and the understanding of the industry I work in leads to professional fulfillment. We should put more funding into vocational schools because they teach those skills and knowledge.

    "text":"&gt; If rich people were really less selfish, then why do they need to wait for UBI? \n\nWell, three responses:\n\n1) There are collective action problems. Lots of problems can't be solved other than through collective action, and even trying to do it *without* collective action is just stupid. An analogy would be if I want to build a house, I might need 10 people to get together and lift the heavy timber. If I can't get those ten people together, I'm not going to try - I'll just throw my back out. That doesn't mean I don't actually want to build the house. Another analogy is war - I may think its a great idea to invade Norway and take their oil. But doing so requires enough people to agree with me such that I can form an army and actually win. Me running through Oslo with a gun by myself simply won't get the job done, and my failure to take that action doesn't mean my belief is insincere.\n\nThis is the problem with almost all the \"if you like this policy so much why don't you go do it yourself\" - it's a really facile way of thinking about policy.\n\n2) Many arguments for higher taxes and UBI are basic moral arguments, and therefore people, very reasonably, believe they should apply to everyone equally. If I think murder is wrong, for example, it's insufficient for me to just refrain from killing people *myself* (though obviously I should), but presumably I'd like to stop other people from doing it as well. \n\n3) People should be more generous in general.

If you\u2019re a long-time opioid user it can take two years for your brain to readjust to not having them \u2014 which feels eternal. Panic attacks, insomnia, suicidal ideation, body temperature control issues, increased sex drive \u2014 they are all withdrawal symptoms and they can all last for years. It\u2019s called PAWS and it\u2019s very real. But even for the initial hell \u2014 like vomiting mixed with adrenaline spikes \u2014 again, it\u2019s really going to vary. After a few days though, Kratom will usually help with the worst of it. It won\u2019t make you feel better, but you won\u2019t feel like hell either. \n\nI did want to add that \u201cwill power\u201d is proven to be almost completely ineffective at treating opioid use disorders, precisely because withdrawal can actually last two years. It\u2019s equivalent to telling cancer patients to \u201cthink positive.\u201d People are dying. We can\u2019t afford to cling to our puritanical myths any longer. If you are struggling, please, find a methadone clinic or try Suboxone. I know methadone clinics are a pain and Suboxone isn\u2019t ideal \u2014 but they are much more likely to save your life than will power is. And that is the ONLY outcome that matters \u2014 saving your life.\n\nPeople often die because they go a few weeks without using, believing that opioid withdrawal is like they portray it to be on TV \u2014 3-5 days and you\u2019re done. Then, 14 days later they have a clinical panic attack and end up using, but they use the amount they used before withdrawal and it\u2019s too much and they OD. If you use again after withdrawal, use way less than you used to use before. \n\nAnd as a more general statement, this post really highlights how deadly the war on drugs has been. It\u2019s unsafe, unregulated supply that\u2019s killing people.  \n\nIt is past time to end the war on drugs. To start, Hydrocodone should be sold OTC so that people have at least have one safe option. The Tylenol in hydrocodone is literally more dangerous than the opioid in it.  \n\nAlso, every doctor should be able to prescribe as much methadone and Suboxone as they want, and rural areas especially need access. Testing kits should be sold at checkout counters and priced the same as a Snickers. So should Narcan. You don\u2019t technically need a prescription to get Narcan where I live, but pharmacists will lie and say you do or give you a huge hassle if you try to get it from them.  \n\nAlso, safe consumption sites needs to be everywhere. So many people die just because they were using alone.\n\nFrom there, in the U.S., we need UBI, guaranteed housing (even if you\u2019re using), and universal health care (including psychiatric help). \n\nAlso, we obviously need to completely stop sending people to jail or prison for drugs. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s friend died because he got pulled over for speeding and was worried about getting arrested for having drugs on him so he swallowed all the drugs he had. He would still be alive if we did not have these barbaric outdated drug laws.\n\nPlease stay safe out there everyone. Never use alone. And always carry Narcan.

VR is going to be in every household when that happens nobody will know what anyone really looks like in that world. And the Vr world will be so dope that in many ways preferable to real life. It will make for purer connections. I play VR a lot and it really does bring people together. There are big economic shifts happening as well. Universal basic income will become a thing within 5 years (lots of jobs disappearing.) automation will replace all tedious jobs, leaving only fun ones that humans chose to do like working in artisanal coffee shops or painting. Robots will become so advanced that in many ways buying a girlfriend robot would be preferable to a real human (have her clean the house do some errands, have sex whenever, maybe even sexual upgrade that humans don't have.) Lastly AI will be so powerful that I bet it can make pills of youth, and we'll have the option to download ourselves into the next level of the simulation or stay on this level.\n\nAlso why not adopt a kid? That's an option\n\nLastly I think you have way more power over your mind than you realize. It's all based on attention, whatever you give attention to in your mind grows cause attention is food for thought.\n\nEdit; I should've just expounded on that last part more that was the value you needed so, an example: I'm getting yelled at. Old me would reflect the anger into sadness because I fell for a belief and in that moment I'd be submitting to the belief that their anger is valid. Psychedelic me doesn't do this because I'm aware that action bears Ill fruit. (Been yelled at a fair amount.) and I'm aware that anger\/ego is generally not valid once you see through the illusion. So the experience has changed now for me because I don't subscribe to beta shit anymore, I'm alpha and you are too. Alpha means confidence. It means not having to prove anything to anyone least of all yourself. It doesn't mean puffing out your chest and eyeing people like they're beneath you. That's beta pretending to be alpha. What if someone comes up to you and tries to convince you the earth is flat? That's the same thing as them trying to convince you to be sad. They are both lies and lies only have power if you submit to them. This is a choice but it may be deeply ingrained habit so it can take some time to notice the exact moment when you fall for a belief and over time you'll get better at not. It's like finding on some level in your mind you are pushing a button and over time you'll learn how to not push that button.\n\nThe most powerful choice anyone can make is to tend to their own thoughts like it's a garden. Try to grow stuff you like and weed out the stuff that doesn't help you.",

    "text":"As someone who is very, very, very far left (anarchist) I think that a basic income can only be positive (given that it's implemented correctly). It will change the employee\/employer power balance, which would end low-paying jobs. It will also most likely give people an actual choice for more free time (a 70% position does not entail a 30% drop in pay) which in turn could give people more time and energy to get educated about politics and hopefully lead people to other conclusions than they currently do.\n\nIt will also make it much easier for people to be in charge of their own work. Starting a business for yourself or creating a coop would both become much more viable, both because you won't starve before you start making money, and because the amount of money needed for a business to be sustainable will shrink.\n\nThere is also the point that regular people on average will have more money, tilting the production towards what most people want, and not just what people who currently have money want. Of course, the problem of consumerism still stands, but then again, it's mostly well of people who seem to end up following their ideals in areas such as consumerism, environment etc.",
