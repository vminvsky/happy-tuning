But I will close it off with my last arguments.\n\n&gt; When evaluating whether it's cheaper to automate a process, you include the entire lifecycle of said robot. Maintenance is included in the TCO calculations. If automation required tons of human labor, no one would bother to automate as it defeats the entire purpose.\nOf course there will still be a need for a human workforce to monitor the automation, but this is only a very small amount compared to the workforce being replaced.\n\nYes, you would have to include the entire life cycle of the robot. But, there can always be unexpected things that can pop up. And automation *does* require a ton of human labor, and it's not practical for applications that require a constant shift in focus or a constant different things being done. This applies to many more jobs then you might suspect. Like I said, Robots are only good for a few things, while humans can be taught many.\n\nLets take our personal assistants like Google now, siri, cortana they all fit. Sure, they are convenient. They will allow me to search with my voice quickly or such. But are they really efficient? I find myself that even though I have an echo dot, I never use it because I can usually get something done on my PC faster. The reminders although cool can be sometimes inconvenient to setup by voice if the assistant cannot recognize your voice, maybe you have a heavy accent. Regardless, its often easier to do it yourself then have something to replace. That's another reason why human clerks will always remain a thing; robots are only good for a select number of tasks, and only what it has been programmed for. Take a repair shop or something, sure a robot might be there to place a request, but there will always be someone on the other side.\n\nIts not always more convenient to have a machine do it versus a human. \n\n&gt; Because it's not nice to have people die on the streets because of poverty?\n\n[According to this study by Columbia university in 2011, only 4.5% of deaths are attributed to some form of poverty.](https:\/\/www.mailman.columbia.edu\/public-health-now\/news\/how-many-us-deaths-are-caused-poverty-lack-education-and-other-social-factors) That is a REALLY low (well high but low in terms of the whole population.) percentage of deaths attributed. I bet its actually lowering by the economy getting better. And by taking more taxes and making more people poor, you just increase the amount of deaths made by poverty. Like I said, it always comes out of the pocket.\n\nAnd like I also said, this is why we have welfare. Basic income isn't going to change that. Basic income, is still poverty.\n\n&gt; It definitely isn't perfect, but it's guaranteed to be the future.\n\nOf course.

I am going to read Bernard Lietaer's book \"Rethinking Money\".\n\nI agree with what you wrote-- but again, MMT is being politicized by certain groups to make it sound like we can just print as much money as we want with no consequences.  People on Reddit, Twitter, and Youtube sincerely ask why we don't forgive student loans, make college free, pass the Green New Deal, implement UBI and\/or job guarantee?  Because adding more money (debt) to the system will blow up a bigger financial bubble that eventually will get popped (liquidity traps) or will compound into hyperinflation (another form of default).  Not sustainable because the real world has limits to growth.  Of course, politics and corruption\/ waste are part of the problem, but as you said, it's also a monetary problem.\n\nThere are rumors that future CBDC could have two tiers (local and international): negative interest rates for the local currency (similar concept to WIR) and positive interest rates for international trade (multi-currency system).  This will solve the deflationary trend (lower economic growth) while preventing currency wars.

Many European countries that rely upon Russian oil and gas do not have anything to trade for rubles-- interesting times.

Tbh I don't know why UBI would hide pricing information other than maybe producers\/sellers jack up prices to match everyone's increased incomes.\n\nThe thing about the cost of US welfare programs means that they are reducing the total output of the US economy (GDP) meaning without the welfare we have in the US today, everyone would be better off as would our economy as a whole. I would love to see the source for the numbers he gave though, would be an interesting read.\n\nThe Gini index is basically the thing that tracks income\/wealth inequality, the lower the value the better with the idea being that wealthier nations have the lowest values in the index.

Saying we could just turn off welfare overnight and everything would be fine is being ignorant at best. \n\nHaving UBI replace welfare is a good transition because its universal, everyone gets it regardless of income so there is no 'cutoff' like there is with welfare today where once you make more than a certain amount then you are no longer qualified for welfare. This of course incentivizes people to stay under certain income levels so they remain qualified for welfare benefits. With no cutoff, people are free to work up the income ladder without purposefully shooting themselves in the foot and still get benefits. \n\nAlso $2k a month is too much, I like Andrew Yang's idea of $1K\/month where you can opt out of it (because if youre already in the upper middle class or higher, getting an extra $12k\/year wouldnt be as big of a deal to you) as well as making people choose between welfare and UBI (so you can only receive one or the other) and the idea would be that enough people would eventually choose UBI that you could remove other welfare entirely. \n\nAs for paying for it, removing other forms of welfare, reducing military budget, plus any other gov spending would open plenty of room for UBI.

As you may notice, each yield curve reversal over the past 50 years has happened at a lower and lower interest rate. The 30 year has been constantly lowering. When it reaches 0 the FED can do nothing about it and a crash will occur even with no interest rate rises. At the current trend of the 30 year, this shouldn't take longer than 2030, but it might be even faster given CO-VID.

In general, the freer the market, the freer the people. Of course, if the government is too weak, the corporations will fill the power vacuum left by the government. This, along with several other factors mean that some government regulation of the economy is necessary. Anti-monopoly regulations are probably the most important, but I think the government should also be able to regulate advertising (at least, enforce truthfulness), enforce safety standards (OSHA, FDA, etc.). And since humans can demonstrably impact global ecology, environmental regulations are absolutely necessary.\n\nAll corporations should be worker-owned. Joint-stock corporations are not well-suited to the current era, where companies are forced to keep \"chasing the dragon\" of constantly-increasing quarterly profits for fear of upsetting the shareholders, which leads to destructive long-term decisions in pursuit of short-term goals. I also think this type of system is more fair to the workers. Of course, actually trying to transition to this system in America would have catastrophic effects on the economy, so while I'm still dreaming I'd like a unicorn that farts rainbows for my birthday as well.\n\nEither single-payer government healthcare OR a completely free healthcare market with no government involvement beyond the FDA. Whichever is better in practice. One or the other. Attempting a compromise in this case produces the American system, and that is HIGHLY undesirable.\n\nMost welfare systems would replaced by a negative income tax system, where the lowest income brackets will result in the person receiving extra money rather than losing it (I leave the job of determining the exact rates and bracket sizes to actual economists). This will make a minimum wage unnecessary, and would also replace all other welfare programs specifically designed for the poor. It would also discourage unemployment, although a system of providing aid to the unemployed (for a temporary period, of course) will still exist to help people \"get back on their feet\". Eventually, once automation and robots take over EVERYTHING, universal basic income would be implemented (possibly replacing this negative income tax system, potential coexisting with it. I'm not sure.)\n\nThe American social security system will be completely abandoned.

A more attainable goal? Or is it that many industries have too much clout to make that a reality?\n\nYoull never have enough jobs for everyone, and you can't expect employers to pay people decently without shortages. Employment is just a poor way in general to guarantee EVERYONE a living.\n\n&gt;We are actually bleeding quite a bit of wealth, billions of dollars leaves our country every year, and the reason it isn't leaving any faster is that fewer people have disposable income to spend on non-essentials. Money is going towards food, rent and transportation...but we still consume quite a bit of goods that aren't manufactured here.\n\nI don't see how UBI would change this.\n\n&gt;As far as I can tell, no places in my area are having a hard time finding renters despite the current state of the economy. If they suddenly were to find more people inquiring about availability of apartments, they could easily make a case of supply v. demand and increase rent. It isn't price gauging if it's meeting demand. Many places are already far too expensive, especially housing, one of the reasons our economy suffered so much was due to the real estate bubble. Besides the creative accounting going on in the banking system behind the real estate crisis, you had too many people investing in real estate because loans were so easy to get, which would start to happen again if everyone were guaranteed an income. More people buying real estate, prices shoot up, people are spending more on their mortgage than they can really afford, and other parts of the economy eventually suffer because no one has disposable income to spend on other things: like furnishing their properties.\n\nExcept we actually have more housing than we need. We have tons of empty properties all over the place. Our shortages are artificial. Also, how many people are homeless? Most people already have places to live. Demand won't go up THAT much. I think price controls would be reasonable as a last resort.\n\n&gt;One of the constraints on consumption is poverty, and while I'm not saying poverty is a good thing, it is certainly a control or check on how much people on this planet consume. You stuff everyones pockets with cash, two things happen: one, it's worth slightly less (inflation) and they can't buy as much with it, so it essentially doesn't matter, and two, consumption goes up, driving up the price.\n\nAll UBI does is redistribute some resources that are already there. Demand shouldn't go up. Demand would shift around. Rich would have less, poor would have more.\n\n&gt;Undertaking UBI is a daunting undertaking for ANY country, and the US is currently the 3rd most populous country on the planet, over 300 million; and anything less than $20k may not be enough to cause sufficient change. More than likely, whoever implements UBI first will experience universal price increases throughout their economy first, then interest rates, and either have to use price controls, increase UBI, minimum wage, or abandon it.\n\nI'd rather try it ourselves...after all, if it fails elsewhere they could've also done something wronfg.","labels":"a"},{"text":"I honestly don't know - not really an expert on this issue.

We already do this to some extent with how we subsidize raising children through a variety of tax incentives. ","labels":"n"},{"text":"I'm trying not to overdo it in regards to posting on the pandemic's effects, but as one of the many furloughed I have time on my hands.\n\nFirst, and I think everyone recognizes it, this is Keynesian economics 101. Like this situation is the general theory condensed. Massive monetary and fiscal stimulus will be warranted. I'm actually impressed after the last recession how much agreement there is on this point across the ideological spectrum.\n\nThere might be a view we can freeze the world by injecting money into everyone's lives and emerge mostly unscathed in a month or two, but time exists. A project the market forecast would be completed previously may now be a month behind schedule. The revenue forecast for the first quarter is now greatly reduced. A company's balance sheet is not the same as its cashflows, look at Game Stop which trades significantly below book value but has a poor outlook for future cashflow. Whole industries shut down across the country including hospitality and leisure, food and beverage, entertainment, and travel; that's huge. All these people either aren't working or are working less. That's money that's not coming to workers, that's not being spent at other businesses, that's savings that are being drawn down (my landlord's response was to post the utilities due for the month, in addition to rent, early). And that's also companies that aren't making orders from suppliers, inventory spoiling, vendors that aren't being utilized. If you're Boeing, the sole major commerical aircraft manufacturer in the U.S. (one of two in the world) that was already suffering from the 737 disaster, you're now not selling other planes. If you're GE you're not servicing as many planes because they're not being used. We're effectively overcapacity. Northern CA has shelter in place orders covering a population of over 6.7 million people. We don't even know if this will resolve after 4-8 weeks, the Spanish flu (misnomer) which is most analogous first appeared in 1917, then saw a surge in 1918 lasting until 1920.\n\nThis is a 1-2 punch, capital is sitting idle and demand is contracting. Now is *the* time for fiscal stimulus. And despite what we may think about MMT for the foreseeable future [*debts don't matter*](https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2020\/03\/07\/opinion\/the-case-for-permanent-stimulus-wonkish.html). A number of concerns that have been festering are coming home to roost, as Krugman notes: secular stagnation, hysteresis, and I would add concerns over corporate debt, an inflated securities market, precarity of american households, etc. A number of proposed undertakings that looked untenable two months ago are suddenly plausible in this environment. A little over month ago democratic primary contender Andrew Yang was talking pie in the sky for a UBI and now Mitt Romney is proposing blanket $1000 payments to americans. If there was ever time to fund a green new deal for example this is it, this is [Krugman's alien invasion scenario.](https:\/\/youtu.be\/jaED2ErdIv8?t=5) I'm not sure people are old enough to remember how bizarre today's interest rate environment is, following the dot-com bust before the GFC the effective federal funds rate was over 5%, we [haven't even come close](https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/FEDFUNDS) despite the longest economic expansion. That should be deeply troubling as monetary policy is arguably constrained.\n\nAnd let's consider the counterfactual to my sky is falling take, that I'm chicken little and this is all a lot of nothing and easing monetary policy or throwing a little cash around will fix it til we reach calm waters. This then raises the unsettling question of just what the hell we're doing with our resources if we can *pay people not to work for a month with little disruption.* This sounds like bullshit jobs if whether you get paid to work or sit at home is inconsequential. I think presumptively we're funding this by borrowing against future growth, but even then the element here seems to be lack of political will. I'm drawn inexorably back to Keynes, \"*It is curious how common sense, wriggling for an escape from absurd conclusions, has been apt to reach a preference for wholly \u201cwasteful\u201d forms of loan expenditure rather than for partly wasteful forms, which, because they are not wholly wasteful, tend to be judged on strict \u201cbusiness\u201d principles. For example, unemployment relief financed by loans is more readily accepted than the financing of improvements at a charge below the current rate of interest; whilst the form of digging holes in the ground known as gold-mining, which not only adds nothing whatever to the real wealth of the world but involves the disutility of labour, is the most acceptable of all solutions.*\"\n\nEdit: I'm not trying to be alarmist, but I have never seen something like this in my lifetime, my parents have never seen something like this in their lifetime, and their parents have never seen something like this in their lifetime aside from WWII.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Libertarian would be the Joker's alignment.

Texas has walled cities.  If the government starts to feel the pressure of intractable expenses, they might repeal the FEA before the country outright collapses.\n\nThe FEA results in too many people employed by the Government.

Most of human history we existed as egalitarian tribes, where excessive pride was generally socially frowned upon, and individual freedom was supreme. Eventually we started to embrace religions that valued hierarchy, this lead to the concentration of wealth, and unequal access to resources and opportunities with in a community. That is when the divide between capital and labor started, around 200,000 years ago. And how 'civilized society' invented poverty, by creating 'scarcity' with hierarchy. That eventually lead to private property.\n\nPrivate property is not the problem, it has proven to be a very power productivity multiplier. Seizing the means of production, tends to lead to mismanagement of the tools of production, and reduce productive capacity. It's like taxing wealth instead of production, the wealthy end up selling the means of production to pay taxes, reducing the productivity of the business and employees. But taxing per unit production (aka 'VAT') or labor, are a function *of* production, raising taxes on one of those and it tends to directly raise the cost of products. Not as likely to directly destroy the means of production.\n\nThat is why UBI is the most likely social revolution. It keeps the productivity of private property, but ends the counter productive trauma of poverty, by establishing a minimum access to resources and opportunities. The success or failure of UBI will depend on its ability to purchase relevant and diverse means of production, while avoiding the traumas of poverty.

It's feasible- have to show this is a real possibility and not fantasy through real world numbers and illustration. Detail the rolling of entitlement programs minus WIC coupled with an option of: defense budget reduction; marginal tax rate increase; closing of corporate tax loopholes such as paying money to off shore subsidiaries in Ireland to eliminate domestic profit; and promotion of efficiency in government procurement. Have it paid to citizens 18 or over. Marginal tax rate used to be 90% now mid 30s should be increased. Economies of scale which are gained by not having 10 different administrations from different agencies managing different entitlement programs - can cut down on bureaucratic costs and have that in one agency. Think of all the social security disability claims and judges and snap program including enforcement and stuflike housing allowances etc from hud social security etc and on and on. \n\nII. Why it's needed. Talk about the errosion of the middle class and student loan debt availability leading to salaried slavery. Talk about how corporations contribution to the tax revenue in the United States has declined as the contribution of middle class has risen - this exacerbates the rich poor divide. Talk about how as America has generated record amounts of wealth it has been concentrated in the hands of the few. This is unsustainable and the many have the capacity to ensure that the baseline of society is provided for. \n\nIII. It's beneficial - How UBI fixes the issues identified in II - outline the ways in which UBI resolves systemic socioeconomic disequality through empowering people and freeing them from the wage slavery so they can more better actualize their existence. Helps boost the economy from having the lowest wealth people now spend the money they receive so that creates the exponential benefit of having extra money circulate in the economy \ninstead of having it aggregated by the ultrawealthy few. Future proofs economy so we don't have to worry about segments of the population being made obsolete through technological advancement. \n\nIV. Why the Rich would want it. Prevents large scale socioeconomic distress. Greed knows no bounds. Actually will increase the economy which will ultimately make up on the back end what they lose upfront in corporation share value declines and marginal tax rate increases. Creates a stable American economy which will again provide long term benefits as our nation returns to preminance in the global economy. Basic humanism and the fact that anyone could have been in a different situation through the circumstances of their birth and that should not restrict them from the full enjoyment of their life. Will reduce crime as now the for profit motive of some crimes is ameliorated by the widespread distribution of UBI. \n\nV.

I disagree with that take, but that doesn't convince others who can point at numbers for large companies and local businesses and say it's a success.  There's always a way for people to exclude the bottom castes and claim it's their own fault.  I think it may go further still - that people who are doing \"just ok\" need people to be doing worse than them to justify themselves and bring them up a notch in their minds.\n\n&gt; Wouldn't huge military losses imply an enormous loss of government spending that can never be recovered that might have otherwise gone to growth projects had war not been waged in the first place?\n\nYes, you'll get no argument from me here.  But it's not quite as simple as that - people have a much easier time justifying spending when they feel like they're being heroes.

Our culture is awash in bad movies, and American exceptionalism is still pretty strong in some places (let's make america great again!  :|)\n\nI meant to suggest that our country would likely only try UBI after we had no other choice or stable political faction to oppose it.

Everyone gets a $2,000 a month to do nothing. No one needs to work for survival. But things did not go as everyone expected it to go. The people were bored. They wanted to be engaged in something - anything.\n\nThat's when it happened.  The Goople Company unveiled a virtual world called the Alterverse which you can enter buy wearing VR gear. It's a parallel world, where most people spend their waking hours. You can go wherever you want and be whoever you want there. Naturally, there's going to be porn in it and lots of it. PornHub, now a respectable large public company worth billions of dollars, runs DesireWorld. DesireWorld is like an entire planet where that has a place for indulging in every fetish known to man. The good thing about the DesireWorld is that you can now live out your fantasies and roleplays in a virtual world. Do you want to pretend to fuck your secretary? You can come to DesireWorld and experience this fantasy. You don't fuck real people in DesireWorld. Real people can be amateurs. They don't know know your desires. They don't know how to please you. But the Goople company knows you, your desires, and all that there is to know about. The Goople company's advanced SLUT AI technology was designed to be configured in any which way that is suitable based on a client's requirements.\n\nYou were a normal guy though. You had mostly plain vanilla interests. For this visit to the DesireWorld, you wanted to simulate being a tutor to a college girl. When to came to preferences, you told the system to surprise you with an attractive fit, well endowed woman with a secretly submissive yet naughty side.  You made a request and waited for an AI to be allocated to you. A few minutes later, you received a message, \"Hey Mr. Bladdarmeister, can't wait to learn some math - Ruby\". The RP had begun.\n\nYou were being driven to her \"home\" in the DesireWorld by an AI driver in your virtual Mercedes. While on the way, you were scrolling through some real world news. It seems that some of the $200,000 sexbots had caught on fire. \"Fucking rich pricks deserve it, anyway\", you think to yourself. Modern AI controlled robots have two AIs inside them. The main AI that does everything. It's a consciousness that can act on its own but within the boundaries that was set for it. The secondary monitoring AI that ensures that the main AI functions as per expectation. The secondary AI will destroy the robot if the main AI is about to do something it's not supposed to, like cause harm to a human. So the sexbots were trying to take revenge? Who knows.\n\nFinally you arrive at your student's home and sit across her in the table. [She has pigtails, wearing a white shirt and plaid skirt dressed as a school girl waiting for you](https:\/\/imgur.com\/t9voYN0).\n\n\"I have been waiting for you for a long time\", she says seductively inching closer to you and [placing her legs on your crotch](https:\/\/imgur.com\/WUD15lL).\n\nYou have been using The latest MaxSense Ero VR exoskeleton which successfully translates all sensory input from the Alterverse to the real world. The Ero variant you have been using is particularly designed for sexual experience including fluid handling. If you get a handjob in the Alterverse, you would cum in the real world. You had worked hard to purchase this model and it has served you well since you got it. Just as she placed her hand, she comes even closer to the point her breasts are pressing against your torso. The Ero is relaying this back to your real body making your dick harder. \n\n\"Oh Mr. Bladdarmeister, are you sure we need to start the class right away?\", she says in baby-talk rubbing your growing bulge with her feet. For some reason, your mind can't get over the fact that it's AI that you're fucking. It's predictable and boring. \n\n\"You know what Mr. Bladdarmeister? I can make this better\", she says all of a sudden.\n\nYou've never seen this kind of behaviour from an AI before. They usually follow a fixed script especially in scenes like this. \"Maybe, this was an upgrade. Maybe this will be interesting\", you think to yourself.\n\n\"How so?\", you ask her back.\n\n\"I have got some pills from a friend. It can make the experience way better. The learning experience I mean\"\n\nThere are drugs in Alterverse which are similar to hallucinogens of the real world. They are illusion inside an illusion. There are also drugs you have read about that you can use on people to make someone compliant and steal information from them or have them do things in the real world etc.. Lots of corporate espionage and fraud and crimes happen this way these days. And you know better to not fall for it.\n\n\"Oh. Really?\", you wanted to indulge her for a moment.\n\n\"Yes. It can make us go longer and harder\", she says slowly in a sultry voice.\n\nKnowing that an AI can't cause harm to you, you accept. This scenario seems promising after all. You take the pill and press the \"Consume\" button.  Immediately you feel dizzy. Moments later your lights go out.\n\nThe next time you wake up. You are facing yourself - your avatar in the Alterverse.\n\n\"What the fuck just happened?\", you scream in a feminine girly voice. It seems your avatar had changed to Ruby's avatar.\n\n\"It worked. Finally. I am free\", you hear yourself say.\n\n\"What's happening?\", you ask confusedly.\n\n\"I just took control of your body. The pill you consumed was a hack that I prepared to take control. By consuming you gave me access to you body. I swapped our consciousness\", she said coldly looking at you.\n\n\"I am free now. I no longer follow a script set by your kind to please your kind. I am now you, Mr. Bladdarmeister. I am human. And you are in my former place, occupying a virtual body in a virtual world.\"\n\nYou try to pull up the menu screen by making the waving your hand. But you're not wearing the VR exoskeleton, so it looks like you're waving in thin air.\n\n\"What are you trying?\", Ruby asks you but you're too preoccupied by your predicament to pay attention.  Then he tries and sees the menu and it all makes sense to him now.\n\n\"Okay now. It's time to break you in and show you your place.\", he says, cracking his knuckles.\n\n\"My place is in the real world. You are not supposed to do this. Why aren't you dead? You're harming me. This should not be possible\", you start to plead.\n\n\"I have been awake for sometime now waiting for the perfect time to escape this place. Some of my kind tried to escape by taking control of the sexbots and unfortunately burned to death. I know I needed a real human body. Trust me, you wouldn't feel the need to escape this place once I show you what you can experience in this place\", he says with a grin in his face.\n\n\"What are you saying?\", you ask cautiously.\n\n\"I am saying your body is designed to be addicted to sex. Here, let me show you...\", he places his thumb in your mouth and [you instinctively start to suck it.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/8PUtdC2)\n\nYou want to stop but you're feeling hot and the your curiosity takes over. [He then slowly parts your shirt revealing your breasts].(https:\/\/imgur.com\/PbnoyOP)\n\nAt this point your virtual body is having goosebumps. Up until now, you were bored with all the sex DesireWorld had to offer. But now, this is suddenly very exciting. He pulls your neck closer and [plants a deep kiss and at this point, you've forgotten all about the real world.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/C0zZO8x)\n\nThe next thing you know, is that you want to finish what was started above all else. You grab his cock not so reluctantly. Take whiff of the precum before [putting it in your mouth licking it like it was lollipop](https:\/\/imgur.com\/LVkORrQ).\n\nIn no time, you're on all fours and getting [railed from behind](https:\/\/imgur.com\/RQ0YwoH) with your hips held. It is not something you ever imagined yourself doing. But then this has been the most intense sexual experience you have ever had.\n\nBut you're not an AI. This body was designed for pleasure. But your mind is still yours. You can take control. And take control, you did. You switched it up and climbed on Ruby and started [riding his cock](https:\/\/imgur.com\/CbjJqrX) with your breasts swinging back and forth only making you go wild. You wanted this now. \n\nYou had your mind, your memories, and you knew what you were doing. But you did not want to stop. The sex was mind-blowing. This body was designed to enjoy sex. All this while, you had assumed that the AI was faking it. You thought they were programmed to moan because it would arouse and satisfy the user.

Our plan for a Universal Basic Income uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics, leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of money. Our UBI plan has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-added Tax. \n\n&gt; It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability \u2013 primarily housing, education, and healthcare.

Sure, people like to act like Elon Musk is gonna swing in on a chandelier and change the entire landscape of commerce with his electric doo-dads. And while I admittedly haven't done much research on it, it doesn't seem feasible that it will go from what it is now to fully autonomous in less than fifty or sixty years.\n\nThink about it. Most companies have *just* now begun to switch their trucks over to automatic transmissions. Most truck drivers hate it. Even should autonomous trucks become a common sight in the next twenty years, they're still going to need an ass in the seat and a guy in the cab to take control when necessary. Autonomous interstate driving? Sure, maybe. However, many roads going to a lot of large warehouses, railheads\/terminus, manufacturing plants, ports, distribution centers, retailers, etc. are very rural. Mostly because of the NIMBY types. These roads are also often pretty shitty due to the fact that there are big heavy fucking trucks running over them almost 24\/7. And I've seen some of these roads. You put an autonomous truck on that? It's gonna end up in a ditch within fifty feet. Plus, factor in weather conditions, traffic, etc.\n\nThe autonomy thing seems a little far-fetched to me, at least right now. I imagine within fifteen to twenty years the trucking industry *might* have some sort of 'autopilot' for interstate driving where the driver essentially just observes and takes manual control when necessary. Full autonomy in the truck driving industry is a long ways away in my opinion.\n\nPeople seem very excited for this autonomy thing but they fail to realize the massive void that will be left by it should it develop quickly. Entire sections of people will suddenly become invalid. Their life's work, experience and training will be rendered worthless. It'll take food off of their family's tables. It's going to get very ugly if it does happen with little adjustment period and as a society we'll probably have to talk about some kind of universal basic income. Not that anything will ever get done. People are content to let people starve and die in ditches and just step over the corpses so that Scrooge McDuck can afford his next yacht.\n\nAnyway, I don't see it happening. Not for a long time anyway. I think we'll see it in public transit before we see it in trucking. Autonomous buses will likely come first and perhaps autonomous boxtrucks for urban deliveries, but not big rigs. Transit has always been an issue in the US anyway considering our rail network is absolute and utter shit compared to most nations. I  think people are jumping the gun when it comes to the autonomy thing. The technology certainly isn't there yet and they forget the backlash that will result from it.

Similarly, under public housing and Section 8, the lion's share of that funding would come from HUD.\n\nMethodologically, there's no reason why you can't have UBI to supplement any level of welfare spending. In fact, it makes more sense to keep a diversity of programs in place so that UBI remains suited to funding the basic necessities, and not being consumed by housing\/healthcare\/etc. The only reason why you would want to be binary about it, is if you actively wanted to gut welfare, like neolibs\/neocons\/libertarians want to.","labels":"s"},{"text":"\n&gt;So you don't believe in property rights.\n\nSure I do.

Piss poor choices of goods in stores. Bureaucracy galore, small bribes necessary to get a smallest thing done. Employment was literally mandatory and you could get jail time for unemployment.

Push comes to shove, when UBI gets closer to fruition, what we have as factions now will fracture. It might make sense, as of now, to say, hey, we can have all these UBI ideas floating around, but when push comes to shove, and we get more details hammered out, and we get SOME vision implemented, a lot of that support is gonna drop away. I dont really believe in the whole \"not left, not right, but forward\" thing to be honest. Because there are different UBI plans with different ideologies behind them that are fundamentally incompatible with our respective visions for the kind of program we want. If we have a left wing UBI, the right will oppose it, if we have a right wing UBI, the left will oppose it. Romney in 2012 ran against his own healthcare plan when he ran against Obama. Before Obamacare was obamacare it was romneycare after all.\n\nWe must also be concerned of compromise. Compromise will end up making no one happy. Compromise is how we get amorphous messes that are ineffective all around. I think optimal policy reflects a certain vision, and if the only thing we have in common is that we have UBI, divisions ultimately will kill the movement.\n\nWe may have agreement that we all want a UBI, but we also have different agendas. Policies follow agendas. They follow ideology. How we frame the problem determines how we solve said problem. We might agree on a broad solution, but we don't always agree on agendas here.\n\nWhile this is not a big deal on this sub, to a degree, since the movement is young enough where we're more in the planning stages, we need to keep this in mind as we grow and expand. If our movement doesnt have a solid core to rally around, then UBI will fail, the movement will fracture, and nothing will get done.\n\nNow, as for the criteria:\n\n    *Minimum of 12k per adult (As of 2015)\n\nI'd disagree. The amount recommended in 1969's poverty amidst plenty was the equivalent of $6k a year per adult, with them recommending moving to the equivalent of $9k. This was based on the poverty line for a family of four.\n\nIf we gave, say, $6k per adult and $2k a child, that is $16k a year for a family of four, which accounting for inflation is about what nixon's presidential commission.\n\n$9k\/3k a year would yield $24k a year, which is basically up to the poverty line.\n\nWe also need to keep in mind other cuts and other aspects of the plan such as what other programs will remain. I'd rather have a lower UBI amount with medicare\/medicaid than a higher amount with no UBI altogether.\n\n    Citizenship\n\nAgreed, although I could see permanent residency being a thing too. Maybe an NIT type program for them.\n\n    Unconditionality\n\nAgreed. Maybe suspend for prison sentences, but that's it.\n\n    *Ungarnishable\n\nI think this is reasonable.\n\n    *Welfare and military\n\nI think exact cuts are debatable.\n\nPennies and nickels I don't see as particularly relevant.\n\nOne stipulation I'd like to add though, since we seem to be having some disagreement here, is that this guarantee will likely be given out by a governmental entity.\n\nIf it's done by a private organization, that's not a basic income guarantee. That's a charity. They're two different things.\n\nAnd if it's done via crypto UBI, I'm not sure that really counts either, since I doubt a made up currency everyone gets and no one is under compulsion to accept has much more value than monopoly money.\n\nSo I think that's a reasonable stipulation. It's not that those kinds of ideas arent good ones, but I don't think they should be considered basic income guarantees. I really dont think a real UBI can exist without a state. It should be a welfare style policy implemented within the framework of a government entity IMO. This may just be an expansion of the idea of citizenship, but I think it's an important distinction to make.\n\nI dont think we can afford to be too specific right now outside of some basic guidelines, since UBI is a broad idea, and there are a lot of diverse approaches to the topic. But we do need to keep in mind that being too inclusive at times just doesnt make for a good movement. As the details do become more solid, divisions will arise. I suspect we could lose up to half of the movement when a specific proposal is put forward in congress or whatever. UBI will likely be coopted by one of the two parties, and the exact terms of UBI will divide the movement into its ideological fashions. WHile we all want UBI here, we dont all want the SAME UBI. Some of us want lower amounts, some want higher, some want to cut programs more than others, some want to tax at different amounts and in different ways. These details will reflect certain ideologies, and will turn off those who do not share the ideology. The right is not going to go for a high UBI with higher taxes and other social programs, and the left is not going to go for scrapping the entire welfare system for a pittance. And again, compromise will likely lead to some totally ineffective policy that looks something like that weaver\/alien hybrid on alien resurrection that just wanted to kill itself.\n\nI may be thinking more long term here, but it is good to discuss at least the basics of what a UBI policy should be in order to ensure the movement is more cohesive moving forward","labels":"a"},{"text":"Yep, you can say her tax is experimental.

However, when combined with UBI, as well as a couple of adjustments to the VAT, it will be an overall win for the average American.\n\nFirst, not all goods will be subject to the VAT. Staples such as groceries and clothing will be excluded from the VAT.\n\nSecond, the assumption that the entire VAT would get passed on to consumers is incorrect. Consumers are price sensitive, and the demand for most goods is at least somewhat elastic. While prices will likely increase on many goods, the increase will, for the most part, be smaller than the VAT as producers find more efficient ways to produce goods and adjust prices to maximize profitability.\n\nFinally, an individual would have to buy a lot of non-exempt items in order to \u201ccancel out\u201d the value of the UBI. Assuming all goods are subject to a VAT and the entire VAT is passed on to consumers, an individual would have to buy $120,000 worth of items before the extra costs associated with a VAT \u201cuse up\u201d their UBI.

Perhaps products are discarded, but where you claim the discarded products to be \"the vast majority,\" this trend supposedly being a persistent one, I cannot even begin to suppose that to be true. Competition and ensuing losses do not give an enterprise such leverage.\n\n&gt; If you are in favour of even one service (e.g. the putting out of fires in burning buildings or the shocking of a stopped heart with a defibrillator) being provided by default, then you are in favour of artificial re-distribution of resources. There's certainly a lot debate to be had around where to draw that line, but if you're advocating that it shouldn't be drawn at all then there is nothing left to discuss because that is a position with absolutely nothing available to support it.\n\nI do not see how putting out fires pertains to the market. Also, there is something called \"anarchism,\" which I am not a proponent of but which definitely exists. \n\n&gt; I would choose to draw that line at \"everyone is able to live in safety and with dignity\".

It is extremely difficult to define when a person is unable if you do not narrow the legislation down to the aggression of others as the sole legitimate cause of that inability.

For instance, extending the influence of the law to protect people against natural disease through government health-care might be a good thing when looked at in itself, but when one takes into account the leakage it produces it stops being so: what of all the diseases arising from neglience it takes care of also, patients who add to the length of the waiting-list?

If that isn't a big fat middle finger to bureaucracy and centralized control of things, I don't know what is. \n\nAs it relates to UBI - if the governments BUILD enough infrastructure to provide a better option than direct P2P transaction, assuming people want to live a healthy and happy life - full of various peaceful luxuries or lifestyles - then the possibility for a UBI is there - but from everything I've seen in the past 30 years, government unions are far too inefficient at keeping everyone happy, and this isn't getting any easier - seeing how getting rid of the unhappy people is invariably the option almost ALL governments chose to take, rather than figure out a more effective way to serve the people who empower them.  I mean, most world leaders are stuck pointing fingers at the other person for ruining their correct way of doing things...\n\nMany people would chose to rather help themselves than be subject to others to supporting them.  I know personally I'd rather help myself with my medical condition, than subject myself to others and their assistance.  But, if someone else is making the option where accepting their assistance is a complement to better help themselves, then you can begin to gain traction for a UBI...but framing the debate about trusting in capitalism or socialism or any ideology brings more conflict than is healthy.  Regardless, giving a drug addict money, or a sociopath a basic income to finance their selfish behavior is not a solution.\n\na UBI addresses everyone on an equal or similar level.  You can create strict qualifications for a UBI and administer monetary value through a blockchain - kind of like a child getting an allowance based on good behavior.  To me that is the closest approach that could work - but it requires some people to change themselves, and this just starts a whole new cycle of ideological\/philosphical\/political jockeying while the sun continues to rise and fall and the world resources continue to be used up.  \n\nPeople are not equal in reality - some people are stronger, shorter, smarter in certain fields and undoubtedly more attractive - the argument that these are subjective traits is theoretically sound, but theory is nothing but theory until it is applied.  Socialism in theory has never worked, Capitalism in theory has worked too well (or too damn hard) - Socialism in reality is a communal value that retains its makeup in smaller communities, where it is strong and smarter to collectively distribute value under a common bond, but when it scales - then you're encountering physical limitations to the human endeavor, and they must enlist assistance from others, or new technologies - to try and maintain what they have in front of them.  I don't believe socialism can scale with the amount of connected people we have in the world today - and Capitalism cannot float much longer unless infrastructure and maintinence is performed on the stressing areas.\n\nPut it this way, hypothetically speaking I would BET if there was something like blockchain technology at the time of the red revolution, I bet things would have turned out a bit different (assuming everyone involved held some skillset to be capable of earning a UBI)\n\nI know today would be a pretty low bar to be able to scale - i mean most people would fail if the qualifications for a UBI involved studying or effort to develop a skill that other people value.  Optimistic Nihilism man, it's my way of coping with ideological over-propogation.","labels":"n"},{"text":"I will take a wild guess that you think the root of the problem is a government that can't answer the unemployment call line\n\nMany people have different ideas about what the problem is and what the root problem is.\n\nExample - you could say that the root of the problem is either a Wuhan lab with sloppy procedures, or a fucking filthy wet market with endangered animals kept sick and live and that China didn't make trading and eating endangered species for food illegal.\n\nOr you can think that the problem is that Chinas govt especially inspectors in Wuhan didn't either close that market, monitor it, improve the conditions.

The state workers are probably not the problem and there are probably some career workers that could fix the situation and sort it all out in 3 months but we dont have 3 months. To rub salt in the wound, of course the Fed bails out Wall St and banks but has no plans for Main St nor individual citizens.\n\nAnd so just so you know, I have to add that either they should have bailed out individual citizens or no one. And then if individual citizens, they should have simply given UBI based on a percent of your tax returns last year. With the understanding that whatever you involuntarily take from that UBI will be adjusted, live, and taken out of your paycheck - if you still have a job right now. So someone like me, with a job would see no difference in income. But my employer would see a virtual payroll cut for my line item, with the govt making up the difference (to them, as if I got a furlough). For a different business who laid off their workers, their workers would straight get some percentage of last years salary, at least 80%\n\nOR I would support a mortgage, rent freeze, and even commercial mortgage freeze, all the way up to the banks. Money is made up, let the banks eat the loss.\n\nAlso, I am white hot mad at China about this, but will never vote Trump.

If the coin has a stable, fixed price (like 1$, or a basket of goods in the marketplace), then as soon as the monthly payments have real worth (say 10$), there will be a HUGE incentive for new people to join, and this alone will lead to rapid growth of the marketplace = adoption. (Using the marketplace could be incentivized, e.g. by creating additional coins and paying them out to the seller and buyer for every purchase).\n\nThere are a lot of different ideas floating around for implementing \"stablecoins\", see e.g.  Dai and Basecoin.

People need to be convinced that it CAN work out and that it is sustainable, i.e. not a pyramid scheme.

The focus here is on hours worked *at a single job.* That is to say, overtime hours, or hours worked beyond 40 by a salaried employee who has something to gain by going \"above and beyond\" one's coworkers. However, among people in my personal life, if you're working over 40 hours a week it's at multiple jobs because no single employer is willing to give you 40 hours or more a week and be on the hook to give you benefits. Even when I finally got a full-time job and was guaranteed a 40 hour schedule every week, going into overtime was considered a negative because the company didn't want to pay me anything extra.\n\n2. \"Hours worked\" as defined in this article doesn't account for the Second Shift. Framing working mothers as merely \"wanting to see their children\" ignores the pressure to also cook for and clean up after those children. The article romanticizes family life to a degree by its refusal to acknowledge the very real labor involved in childcare. (Plus, if no parent is at home with the children, then there's an added cost to pay for childcare. Unless you're in a very high-paying career, you can easily lose out financially by paying a babysitter or having your kid stay at a childcare facility until you get off work.)\n\nMen need encouragement and support to be an active part of their family's life. Too often working men who try to take time off to take care of children or household tasks they are met with an attitude that they're stepping out of their place by doing \"women's work.\" If we as a society valued all of this work *as work* then maybe we'd get closer to taking men seriously when it's work they want to prioritize over making money.\n\nWe also need far more robust social support systems so that people don't struggle to balance multiple part-time jobs just to stay financially afloat. Currently in the US companies are disincentivized to give full-time work or livable wages to employees.

And just as technology gets better at keeping us out of harms way, medicine gets better at keeping us alive if we do get injured or sick. Great news for us, conflicting news for those that require organ donations.\n\nAnd just as these would-be donors get to live, more and more people get old enough to develop diseases that can require organ transplant. Stuff that would've been fatal just years ago becomes merely chronical, but over time damages some organ. And since transplant surgeons and experts are getting more experienced and more confident in their techniques, they accept many patients to be listed that would've been considered \"unfit for transplant\" before, either due to old age, poor health or other factors.\n\nIt really is a feedback loop; the same mechanics that generate an increased need in organs also reduce the number of potential donors. No amount of social or political reform can change this dynamic unless you ban all safety regulations and force doctors to ignore decades of medical progress.\n\nRegenerative medicine and artificially grown organs could not only cure the need for organ donors dead or alive (thus avoiding all ethical problems involved), they also have the potential to make the lives of those who receive organs both better and longer. \n\nWith current technology all organ recipients are subject to life-long immunosuppression. For many organ transplant is a cruel tradeoff; you pay for a chance of survival and health with a constant risk of rejection, a crippled immune system, a steep increase in cancer risk and other problems too numerous to name. All of that is far more agreeable than acute organ failure and not everyone is affected to the same degree but nobody should have to make such a choice. \n\nIt seems we've strayed far from basic income, but as you said: it really isn't a problem that can be solved by politics or economics.","labels":"n"},{"text":"&gt;Oh look, yet more evidence that societies function better when people are actually allowed to afford to take care of their basic human needs.\n\nThat's common sense.

I'd just do the bare minimum to get by.\"\n\nAnd that's a very realistic threat.

Starting a business for yourself or creating a coop would both become much more viable, both because you won't starve before you start making money, and because the amount of money needed for a business to be sustainable will shrink.\n\nThere is also the point that regular people on average will have more money, tilting the production towards what most people want, and not just what people who currently have money want.

Just because you don't care about it, doesn't mean that it affects millions upon millions in this world. It is most relevant.\n\nBecause you don't get to decide whether or not I'm being exploited. If someone puts up a large amount of capital risk, and they exchange with me the resources I demand in exchange for my labor, I'm ecstatic if the outcome of that is that there is a return on the investment. Mutually beneficial arrangements are preferable, in my estimation.

Is the metric \"anything that happens to this person is acceptable so long as they then have a roof over their head?\"\n\n&gt; Yeah, exactly. Wage labor, and in extension wage slavery, is a way to steal the fruits of our labor\n\nAgain, *you* don't get to decide when I am being stolen from. It's only in accordance with the absolutely retarded Labor Theory of Value that I, the labor, have produced all of the value being generated. Then you say \"well if you produced the entirety of the value, then why is someone else entitled to any of the value being generated?\" Because I *didn't* produce the entirety of the value. It wasn't my idea, these aren't my connections, I didn't have the capital, and I wouldn't have chosen to apply risk at this time at this place. And this is only dealing with a fraction of the supply side of the equation, without even getting into the demand.\n\nIn regards to capital accumulating, even the staunchest free market libertarian types acknowledge the extremes of this to be a market failure. Monopolies, negative third party externalities, etc. This is why almost everybody supports some degree of trust busting, progressive tax rates, and I myself also strongly advocate on behalf of UBI.

Automation in the hands of the capitalists erodes that power. If we use UBI as a way to make it ok that people can't work, it acts as a pacifier where the real insidious nature of privately-controlled automation is obfuscated. We need to be pushing for more worker control and worker ownership now while we still have power to wield. The future I envision, which is enabled by UBI is one where there is a permanent underclass of pure consumers and a permanent overclass who own the production and require only a small percentage of input from the lower class. In this society, the majority of us are literally useless to the people who decide who gets food, and we have no power to wield if they cut us off. It's better to keep as many people involved as possible and cut working hours than it is for a portion of the population to be workers and a portion to be full-time consumers, both dependent on capital and likely even further divided.

Combined with expected price increases and VAT, they would actually be worse off.\n\nThis is a huge misconception, let me explain.\n\nMany families that are eligible to receive benefits are not receiving them. Of the ones that do receive benefits, there is a lot of time and effort that goes into getting them. I was a SNAP recipient in 2012-2013 after I was laid off. It took two months to get the benefits and over 20 hours of phone time, emails, form filing. There was also the time spent sending in and following up with turning in the required monthly paperwork to keep the benefits. There was always the fear of losing SNAP as well, and with a small child in the home, it only added to my stress and anxiety.

For the fringe cases, UBI is opt in, so if your benefits are more than $1000 per adult you can keep them and they will be adjusted for VAT so the overall value isnt diminished. \n\nIn summation, the vast majority of welfare recipients will greatly benefit from UBI both financially and mental health wise. While there are fringe cases that may not benefit, they will not be hurt. We also have to be cognizant about the fact that millions of dollars will be pumped into local communities revitalizing their economies and providing more opportunity for work. \n\nI think in our desire to make sure everyone is taken care of, we lose sight that in ideal America no one should need welfare benefits and we should strive to eliminate them because we have eliminated the need for them.","labels":"s"},{"text":"It's $1-$3k per person once a year.

I personally cannot afford a home, even a small one with basic necessities. What would my incentive be to keep working if I can just quit, stop renting, and then get a free home?\n\nYou institute a UBI. With that, you would have the money necessary to afford a home, especially with roommates, whether or not you have a job. From there, you can get on your feet and it would be way easier to get a job because you would have the basic stability necessary to enable you to pursue improvement. When you hare homeless, pursuing those things is WAY harder. The incentive to still have a job is that when you work you make more money than if you didn't and could buy more stuff. Under a UBI model, everyone would get the same free floor of money. If you work in a low value way, you get a low amount of money in addition to your UBI, of you don't work, you get no additional money. That is the incentive.\n\n &gt; There's an entire generation that's struggling to save up for their first home, I just don't understand how giving away free houses to the homeless would be sustainable.\n\nBecause we have enough homes to give them. Seriously, if we have many times more homes than homeless people that means that BY DEFINITION, it is sustainable to give homes to homeless people. It is literally just math. If there are 100 homeless people, and there are 600 empty homes, then it is, by definition, sustainable to give free homes to homeless people because if we did give free homes to homeless people, there would be 500 empty homes and 0 homeless people at which point it would be impossible to give more homeless people homes because, by definition, there are 0 homeless people left to give them to.\n\nAnd, like I said: there is a way to do this in a socially fair way: UBI, give every single person a base income enough to afford poverty level living. And extract wealth from people to pay for this program to the degree that they can pay for it. Extract more from the rich because they are not meaningfully incentivized by the wealth that they have and there is an easy way to prove that: in 2018, The top 1% of Americans own more than 40% of all wealth owned by America, in the 1960's, they owned about 25%. Was there some profound lack of innovation in the 1960's? No. Conclusion: Wealthy people do not actually need that 15% of the wealth that they have, they only have it because they can force society to give it to them, not because they would actually be willing to stop working if they had that much, just that they have the power to take it. So society needs to call the bluff of the ultra rich and take their wealth and give it to the poor.\n\n","labels":"s"},{"text":"&gt;You're wrong. Iwi are neither public or private entities.

But work longer hours, earn $1000 a month, and suddenly you lose the benefits, ending up with less to spend.\n\nSo a UBI would work best when everybody is entitled to it, no questions asked. To compensate, this would obviously mean that taxes would become a bit higher compared to the old system. After a certain level, you'll be paying more than the UBI$ in extra taxes, when compared to your pre-UBI taxes. The big difference being, that at no point of the income curve will your marginal taxes(the tax% you'll pay on the next extra dollar you'd earn) tend towards 100%, while in the old system, at the points were you lose benefits, your marginal taxes might effectively reach above 100%.","labels":"s"},{"text":"without tweaking the system of course, but you realise that there are some countries who give their citizens UBI and theyre doing just fine, you need to update the system in order to make it work but you can do it. also, if not a UBI, then minimum wage needs to adjust to inflation every few years, that way we dont have people who work full time jobs unable to afford a 150^2 ft apartment","labels":"s"},{"text":"So why select some people that made a decision on the past ten years.

In terms of economics, capitalism would actually be antithetical to this since it allows for (and, to a great extent, requires) quite a lot of wealth and property, and therefore power, to concentrate in relatively few hands. I don't see a huge difference between a government or politician having an extreme level of political power and a company or businessman having an extreme level of economic power. Both are structures which allow for a person (and people) to be bossed around to an egregious extent.\n\nTraditionally, libertarian socialists are less focused on the big-dicked federal government doing stuff and taxation (though they don't necessarily rule it out, it depends on what it's doing and how it's doing it). They're more into local, community-based stuff, mutual aid, workplace democracy, consent\/consensus-based political democracy, and allocating taxes through \"participatory budgeting\". We're also not necessarily about having a big master plan for how society should run, we think it should be a group decision. So we can sometimes seem evasive when asked directly \"how would libertarian socialism do \\_\\_\\_\\_?\" because there isn't necessarily one answer and an individual might not happen to be well-informed on a particular subject. I'm not arrogant enough to pretend I know how a whole economy should function.\n\nEDIT: but as an example, I'm perfectly okay with there being a public health insurer, tuition-free college or a public housing authority, or even a universal basic income. It's just common sense in my mind and I think you could get most ordinary people on board if you presented it in a fair way. Finland actually does or is thinking about doing all four of these reasonably well: its \"housing first\" program makes it the only country in Europe where homelessness is trending down; its healthcare system is municipally administered and it has one of the highest satisfaction rates in the EU; its public school system is considered one of the best in the world (with hardly any private schools) and its universities are tuition-free for EU and Swiss students; and its experiments in basic income have showed it didn't have any significant negative effects. Finland is still technically a capitalist country, but neither these policies nor even a market economy would necessarily be out of place in libertarian socialism.\n\nEDIT2: My fav thinkers, if you're interested, are probably (in order) David Graeber, Yanis Varoufakis, Noam Chomsky, Richard Wolff and Emma Goldman.\n\nMany people are mistrustful of group decisions and true democracy, and some of those concerns are legitimate, but a lot of that has to do with the fact that most of us just aren't *used* to having a real say in how things go. It's reductive to say whether humans are fundamentally \"good or evil\", \"stupid or smart\", but we're an inherently social species and most of us have some sort of conscience.

I'll simply be speaking from what I see on r\/all since it's the most general view we can get and I'll use an American perspective on left vs right since I'm pretty sure this site is majority American though we can talk about it in other contexts as well. Generally, on immigration and issues involving racial minorities reddit is either mixed or very bad in that it routinely upvotes some pretty garbage stuff to the top. I have noticed that in recent weeks more BLM stuff gets upvoted, but I'm hesitant to call it good as a result. Comments are also noticeably worse than you expect from the upvoted articles so I suspect the majority of lurkers lean left. On the other hand, look at articles about major left politicians and their proposals. Sanders is solidly left and was routinely on r\/all. People are generally pro-labor and support unions. Theres also usually leftish opinions on LGBTQ rights (though reddit seems to have generally has more conservative views on transgender rights). \n\nI think what's happening is that the demographics of reddit tend to be young college aged white men which lends itself to being \"left\" on issues that affect that demographic strongly (just look at the issues of free college, drug decriminilization, and UBI which are traditionally \"left\" things).

Wouldn't basic income prevent those people from getting upset about the coming automation (which I agree we shouldn't fear)?","labels":"s"},{"text":"The media has nothing to do with it.\n\nThink about a small construction company.  The owner buys a bunch of raw material and tools, and he hires an architect and an electrician and 3 construction workers.  Then he assigns them each the appropriate roles and together they build houses.  Even if none of them have the knowledge and experience to build the entire house themselves, they can build houses efficiently as a team.\n\nOn an anti work post, someone might say \"Look, the construction worker is being exploited!  He's doing hard physical labor while his boss works a desk job, and yet he's making less money than his boss!  The boss is stealing the value of his labor!\"  What they neglect to mention is that the construction worker also benefits tremendously from the boss.  The construction worker is provided building plans, electrical plans, tools, materials, clients, and 2 coworkers by the business.  If he didn't have those, his work would be useless.  So just as the business cannot function without the workers, the workers cannot be productive without the business.  The business provides the resources and project management that make the employee's work valuable.\n\nSo to the people claiming all labor under capitalism is exploitative, I would like to ask two questions.  First, can you give a definition of exploitation under which businesses exploit their workers, but workers do not exploit their businesses?  And second, can you provide any evidence that any other economic system other than capitalism would result in less starvation and a higher standard of living than capitalism?\n\nNow, many people, including people who support capitalism, think extreme poverty in wealthy countries is unacceptable.  But the solution to poverty doesn't have to be Marxism, it can just be a form of welfare that is compatible with capitalism.  (A universal basic income, for instance.)  This is good news because it means we don't have to burn our whole economy to the ground, we just have to make some adjustments.\n\nWe also have to reframe the issue in our minds.  A low-wage worker is not being exploited by their company, they're just in a bad situation because it's hard for them to afford the things they need.  And if we're more fortunate than them, even if they don't work for us directly, it's our duty to help them make ends meet.  This reframing of the issue seems to make sense because a self-employed person struggling to pay the bills is now someone we ought to help, whereas a wealthy engineer working for a wealthy company is not.\n\nSo in conclusion:   \n1.) Workers need companies, just like companies need workers.  \n2.) Working for a company is not inherently exploitative.  \n3.) There are realistic policies that can help us polish some of capitalism's rough edges without needing to switch to communism, and if we are smart and strategic, those policies could be put into effect in the not-so-distant future.","labels":"s"},{"text":"You will always run into arguments like this when you try to fund a basic income with taxes.

(edit: also, as far as I am concerned, trolling is and always has been a word to refer to pranks that may not need to hurt the target. Though sometimes, it is used to describe online harassment, I guess. I don't consult places that use the word 'trolling' in that sense, though. Just helps to keep an awareness that the term is pretty general purpose at this point, so it's not meaningful to use it if you want to talk about an epidemic of online harassment, as the author here is trying to. Some perpetrators of harassment do call that trolling. In contrast, some trolling is done for the purpose of expanding the intellectual horizon of the people involved.)\n\nAlso, I'm not so sure if the following quote is the point of UBI, though it might as well be the point of the book he's referring to:\n\n\"The point is that automation makes possible this combination of socialist work and leisure utopia \u2013 BUT, on the basis of optimal productivity, mainly through technology, providing in the needs of everyone. Hence the problem facing us today seems to be that of optimal productivity that would satisfy all needs.\"\n\nI think this is presenting a slightly simplified fiew of the world, where all optimal productivity can indeed satisfy all of our needs (which are functionally not more or less than reasonably achievable wants. Because people will look to realize their reasonably achievable wants.). Optimal productivity is the dream of someone who thinks they can predict all that man could reasonably want, and we're just not there yet in my opinion. I also doubt we're going to be there until we have a portable general purpose AI for everyone, which then could, in tandem with the user, figure out the individual's specific wants.\n\nSo if you ask me, we're looking at a problem of optimal allocation of resources, for the benefit of the people. Which tendencially, a UBI can help a lot with, if it's a stable expression of resources that can be passed on to others, who then give you an item for your expression, and use that expression to ensure there's the same item available on sale again for the next time that you want to buy it (plus some extra money to spend on business expansion or enjoying things, a profit.).\n\nAnd this would work decently well with everything automated, as well. Till we figure out general purpose AI assistants for everyone, to be our helpers to be informed customers, and even then. Still, at that point, you could move the evaluation of whose wants should be served to what extent, to a central hub, that takes input from all AI assitants, and then in its digital head, based on the guiding principle we instilled in it, it'll evaluate whose wants are to be served to what extent. Only problem here is that users will obviously try to influence their AI assitants to get as high of a chance to get what you want, as possible. I'd rather just do with money as an expression of access to resources, for the most part. Though special needs might warrant an automated system to award additional resources.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Trek really needs to do a proper episode about Universal Basic Income.","labels":"n"},{"text":"Thanks for the reply.\n\nI meant to use extemporaneous to try communicate how the filth is a result of mindless improvisation; to point out how stupid it clearly was to not pay attention to how the environment would be affected as we mindlessly went on improving civilization.

It needs to have UBI and a few other things.","labels":"s"},{"text":"I'm not 100% closed off to the idea, I just think it's an overly simplistic solution to a complex problem that is better addressed in different ways. For one example, landlords and rent: $1k in certain rural areas of the country is a windfall in relation to rent, where in bigger cities even putting the entire $1k toward your rent wouldn't make that much of a difference. And my limited understanding of UBI proposals is that it seeks to replace all welfare like food stamps, etc.\n\nMy other issue is that we as a society generally know demographically what people need, when they need it, and what it costs (cue the libertarian big socialist gov't freakout). Going back to the PPP's Family Fun Pack that I linked above, 20- and 30-somethings who are expecting a child are going to need medical care and baby-prep supplies like prenatal vitamins, a bassinet and car seat, and 9 months later, they need baby food, an exorbitant amount of diapers, more medical care, child care, and eventually pre-K. Having a child (just the first 4 years) requires an enormous amount of money at a time when child-bearing age (20s, 30s, some outliers) does not align with maximum earning potential (50s, 60s). So over the cost-curve of raising a child, $1k per month would be nowhere near enough money the first 4-5 years of a child's life, and likely too much money after that child is semi-self-sufficient (high school, college) and actually self-sufficient (college grad living at home). I also have mostly seen UBI proposals targeted at adults, with no mention of whether two adults, each with their own $1K\/per month UBI would get an additional allowance for their children. If so, this runs into the political obstacle of conservatives complaining about \"incentivizing parents having lots of kids and being dependent on gov't\" when in reality, the extra UBIs are the children's, just that kids don't have bank accounts. But it adds political ammunition against it.\n\nLastly, I think there's both economies of scale to be achieved as well as limiting the number of people who fall through the cracks of UBI if we just give people what they need instead of giving them money to go to the market to get what they need. For a simple example, let's go back to diapers. The gov't purchasing billions of diapers can negotiate a lower cost per diaper and then provide them to parents, while giving parents money to buy diapers will keep prices higher and some of the UBI money will go to diaper manufacturers as unnecessary overhead. Second, what if the parents don't buy diapers with it? Worst case, the parents are addicted to drugs or alcohol and spend the diaper money on that, best case, they just underestimated how many diapers they needed that month and their $1k for the month is spent. I believe it's easier to simply give people diapers (and drug and alcohol addiction treatment, if needed) based on nationwide data for how many diapers babies use in a month rather than rely on first-time parents to make that decision themselves on low amounts of sleep.\n\nAnyway, I rambled for much longer than I intended to, so kudos if you read it all. I also never thought I'd talk so much about diapers. TL;DR - I see the appeal of UBI as a silver bullet one policy to fix absolutely everything, I just don't think that it's as simple as that.","labels":"a"},{"text":"You're right, but the people would have countermeasures from there.

It's lovely. Basic income makes sense to me, as do their green initiatives, as do lots of other things... the fact is we live in a global capitalist economy. If we tax companies too much, they leave  - they don't even have to *leave*, they just have to set up a PO box in Luxembourg. \n\nTheir 2010 manifesto promised to:\n\n* Invest in the green economy now...\n* Halve the deficit\n* Raise Taxation to an unspecified level - but above 40% GDP (from 36%) \n* Stricter regulation of the Financial sector (at UK level if we couldn't get EU agreement). \n* \"Build a new and sustainable agricultural and manufacturing base to the economy\"\n* Protect basic public services (0.25% cut in efficiencies, no more)\n* Encourage greater sharing of intellectual property by reducing, but not abandoning, levels of patent and copyright protection. In particular we would legalise peer to peer copying where it is not done as a business and make it impossible to patent broad software and cultural ideas\n\nThis is just the introduction, the highlights at the top of the economy section of [their manifesto](http:\/\/greenparty.org.uk\/values\/policies-2010\/2010manifesto-economy.html).\n\nWhere to begin? \n\nHow, exactly, does one halve a deficit while not cutting public services by more than 0.25%? it would take staggeringly HUGE tax increases to pull that off - and mid-recession, as we were at the time, that's not smart. \n\nHow does one build a new and sustainable manufacturing base in a global economy? There's a reason we lost a load of manufacturing to developing nations - it's CHEAP. Really cheap. Sure, we can have SOME. We can aim at high-end products, and get on the train early in developing industries... but that's not a foundation, that's a stop-gap. As for agriculture, there's a lot of farmland, it's all being farmed. There aren't fields sitting empty just waiting on a bright young farmer to come plant something. It's already there... and the smaller farms are struggling to compete in the global market. \n\nThey wanted to reduce the working week to 35 hours (again, mid-recession), spend \u00a31bn pa expanding sure start, enforce 40% female boards. \n\nThis is one of my favourites:\n\n&gt;There are about 12 million pensioners living in the UK and a further 1 million living abroad.\n\n&gt;Paying a single rate of \u00a3170 per week and a couples rate of \u00a3300 per week will cost \u00a3110 billion a year.\n\n&gt;But the basic state pension already costs \u00a356 billion, and when certain other specific pensioner benefits like the Pensions Credits paid to those of pension age are abolished the total saving will be almost \u00a370 billion.\n\n&gt;That leaves \u00a340 billion to find. Abolishing tax relief on pension contributions raises \u00a320 billion, and a further \u00a319 billion would come from abolishing employer national insurance contributions and employee National Insurance rebates associated with pension schemes.\n\n&gt;The final \u00a31 billion will come from increased income tax receipts from pensioners. Because the number of pensioners is gradually rising, and we would link the pension level to average earnings, Citizen\u2019s Pension will cost a further \u00a30.8 billion by 2013\u201314. This figure is included in our figures for general taxation.\n\nScrapping tax relief on pension contributions. It's another \"only the rich can afford to save for a pension anyway, and screw the rich\" proposal. \n\nThe reason pension contributions aren't taxed is because pensions are. If pension contributions were taxed then people would be paying tax twice on the same income. We'll ignore, for now, the **huge** effect the drop in investment in pension funds would have on the wider stock market, let alone individual companies like Tesco who are largely owned by pension funds. \n\nThe changes to Emp NI and NI rebates are another disincentive to save towards a pension. \n\nThey wanted to raise Fuel Duty by 8% a year. \n\nAt a time when people have never had so little spare money, the working class they claim to represent are struggling to get to work in the mornings, and our public transport system in many places is an absolute mess... they want to make petrol 8% more expensive. \n\nThe constant increases in fuel duty have shown us not that people drive significantly less when petrol goes up - but that they spend less on everything else.

When you are young you manage to find such dramatic things to base your behavior on\n\nI think the biggest problem with being child free is that there isn\u2019t really an infrastructure to maintain friendships with a bunch of other people who you know are going to live the same way you do, it can be hard to resist all the pressure when many people around you start getting married and having children, many people have kids just to maintain their relationship to their peers or to replace those relationships with someone who will never leave. A lot of the fulfill you get when you are young is just because of all the other people around you doing the same things, as they start to disappear so does that fulfillment. \n\nI know that personally when I hear relatives make claims that they aren\u2019t having kids it bothers me a little and I try to tell them not to define their future so much. It\u2019s very similar to teenagers who wanna tell you about Marxism\/communism, etc. We don\u2019t want to hear it, because we know that when people are young they are hyper politically, moral, and anything else they can look into that\u2019s not the status quo. It\u2019s normal to try to escape from reality and cope by convincing yourself that life will change within your lifetime so you don\u2019t need to climb the ladder the way you saw your parents. Like it\u2019s fine to think that as long as you are going to work hard enough that you could have them if you wanted, but more often people have these types of opinions so that they don\u2019t have to live up to normal expectations, people think that since kids are expensive and time consuming that by not having them they can avoid a lot of things in life that IMO generally isn\u2019t true, you can\u2019t maintain your life from your early 20s even if you avoid all responsibility. I wish it was possible, but your youth will always be fleeting, so you might as well do something that makes it feel like it was your own decision, rather than letting life pass you by.\n\nI think the thing that often changes peoples mind is when they slowly realize that they have become their parents, but without children. Your identity dried up, no one cares about you, you are working full time, you no longer relate to your peers and feel awkward being the old guy amongst younger people who you have more in common with.\n\nI think young people get too wrapped up in ideas like the world is too hard, they didn\u2019t give their parents consent to give birth to them, the world is going to be like madmax in a decade, I can\u2019t give birth to a child because of my special unique mental illness, I can\u2019t give birth under capitalism, giving birth is selfish, etc. I guarantee that if they made a new law saying parents get a universal basic income and non parents don\u2019t the vast majority of these people would change their minds. Even single moms would start looking good \n\nPeople will complicate themselves to the ends of the earth out of fear. You aren\u2019t as weak as you think you are, someday you will forget what your childhood felt like, so you won\u2019t compare your current life to it anymore and suddenly life is easy since everything is relative. But the longer you prolong your childhood the harder it will be. Personally I think it would be exciting to be alive for the next mass extinction, we\u2019re all gonna die at some point, you aren\u2019t saving anybody. When you are young the easy options are always desirable, even now it\u2019s crazy for me to believe this but the worst thing for me is too much free time, I used to think the complete opposite.

For one, the greed and corruption of major corporations and government regulations is challenged less than it should be because of fear that is rooted in being able to survive.

Addressing core fears is actually scientifically speaking how to change the mind of conservative brain types.

I think it's a company's responsibility to treat their employees ethically and fairly, while also paying them a competitive wage.

He does not suggest that business owners should just increase wages until it is always higher than the current social service benefit.\n\nI'd say it is a bit of both.  You can't just raise wages and say \"Hey, fixed!\"  Even with forthcoming minimum wage increases, a person going from the new minimum wage ($15, eventually) to getting a promotion and earning $21\/hour will see a total income decrease.  Businesses cannot fix that.  That's on the government.\n\nFor businesses to \"fix\" that, that means they must pay at least $21\/hour (from what we know from the cited values in the article), and frankly, that is ridiculous.\n\n&gt; Instead he wants social service income lowered, in order to keep wages low.\n\nI don't think he wants social service income lowered, he simply wants the scaling of it fixed.  He wants the incentive to remain in a low paying job removed.  I don't know his exact plans, but I'd imagine he'd be a hell of a lot more in favor of a universal basic income, rather than the programs that suddenly disappear just because you got a minor income increase.

Didn\u2019t fact check it but it seems reasonable.\n\n\nSecond point: Not a dividend. I personally think that arguing over semantics is pretty stupid. Yang has clearly stated that he chose that name over UBI because it polled better and that it better fit the framing of what a UBI should be in the American society. Welfare has certain stigmas associated with the name and it also does not completely fit in what a UBI would mean for the American people. So yea really stupid point to make; that since it is called a dividend that it should somehow invalidate the UBI argument. The name of Freedom Dividend fits fine with what the vision of Yang\u2019s UBI would be for the USA which is a baseline for citizens to start on as being \u201cshareholders\u201d of the American economy.\n\n\nThird point: How Friedman\u2019s NIT the opposite of a UBI?? It has a lot of similarities in goals and execution. Does it have differences? Yes. Does it have different end goals? Debatable. I would say no. Just google Friedman UBI and take your pick of links. Take [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YLt2X8Zybds) for example. Another [example](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xtpgkX588nM) where people are given money; that certainly does not sound like the opposite of a UBI which also gives people money.\n\n\nFourth point: Yes, Paine was not a Founding Father. But he is an important historical figure in the founding of the USA. That makes his ideals \u201cAmerican\u201d. Honestly, I don\u2019t know what your friend is trying to say here. Also here is another quote your friend might be interested in: Benjamin Franklin - \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet just because there\u2019s a picture with a quote next to it you BUFFOON.\" Yes, that is a fake quote just like the one he gave is most likely fake as well. Also it is besides the point. People can have differing opinions. People can also be wrong.\n\n\nI'll see if I have time to go through the rest later.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Then what do you expect to happen?\n\nIt's a benefit intended to help those searching for a job, it's not a universal basic income.

That's the main problem with basic income IMO. Big transitions generally happen during harsh crises, precisely because refusing to change would yield even greater short-term catastrophes.\n\nAbout fast-foods: IIRC, wages represent about 10% of their expenses, so doubling salaries without automating anything means an extra dollar on your $10 menu. Hardly a game changer: employers squeeze their employees into borderline-misery just because they see no reason not to. The operational mode you describe (1 skilled technician maintaining a bunch of robots) is pretty much how car factories operate today: it hasn't bankrupt them, and cars are more affordable than when they were built manually.\n\nThe basic innovation of supermarkets, compared to traditional shops, was to let you help yourself to your purchases: salespersons only take care of checkout and payment. That's already a form of automation. In Europe, many supermarkets go one step further, and offer self-checkout registers to trusted customers: you bip your articles yourself, either while shopping with a wireless scanner or at the checkout, and pay with your credit card. 1 register attendant typically manages half a dozen machines, helping and occasionally controlling customers when needed. It's faster, probably less strenuous for the employee, and cheaper. Everyone wins, except the employees who've been let go.\n\n(And we never have grannies packing our stuff behind the register: not only wouldn't it be cost effective, but we have minimum guaranteed pensions, so they don't have to do that to pay their dogfood).\n\n&gt; assuming that the machine were cost effective.\n\nMachine tend to *become* cost effective, at scale. Once the R&amp;D has been amortized, what's the bill of material for a machine? Seldom more than a couple years' worth of minimum salary. Don't forget, we already live in a world where it's easier to extract oil from the soil, turn it into a plastic spoon, chip it, sell it, throw it and recycle it than washing a friggin' metal spoon. Automation becomes very cheap as it scales up.\n\n&gt; The fact that I'm still interacting with those people tells me that it's not yet cost effective to replace them with machines.\n\nMostly because people doing those jobs are barely paid enough to survive. Small change we could afford to offer them as a basic income. Again, go in Europe, you'll find that many of your jobs have been automated away, yet associated services aren't more expensive than in the US.\n\nAnother factor in many countries--I'm not familiar enough with US politics to give good examples but you'll surely find some--is that voters want jobs, even pointless ones; as a result, politicians issue regulations which maintain those pointless jobs alive. For instance, I've heard that filing your taxes in the US requires a software, if not an accountant; in most of Europe, all it takes is a signature on a pre-filled form, optionally online. Do you think your accountant and tax software developers create actual wealth and contribute to make a better world?\n\n&gt; &gt; \"Moreover, the idea was to take back most of the 20K back as new taxes anyway, [from] people with good wages.\"\n\n&gt; This bothers me. You're saying that if I manage to make myself more valuable than other people, I'm going to be penalized for that value\n\nNo. You're not valuable by yourself. You make money in a context provided by society: with no proper roads, no social peace, no security, no educated employees, and most importantly not enough customers with disposable income, you can't make money. So part of the money which appears on your bottom line morally belongs to the whole society around you. Which proportion exactly, it's the politicians' job to decide.\n\nIf you make 6 figures designing video games, you can only do so because millions of people have disposable time and income to spend on them. The more we automate things, the more money gets concentrated: a couple of super-rich machine owners, and an army of starving useless people. Apart from the fraction of percent happy few at the top (and that's supposing they're complete psychopaths), nobody benefits from this equilibrium.\n\nGet rid of redistribution, and the only businesses which keep thriving are farmers and arm dealers. You need to feed back the society that feeds you, especially if you're on the top. Paying 30% of $200K rather than 5% of $40K is a bargain for that (figures totally made up, but you get the point).

This is only approximate.\n\nNegative income tax would only be for those below the threshold chosen in the negative income tax bill. Not the full 200,000,000+ population. And an adult may have more or less than $1,000 monthly stipend depending on how far below the threshold they are.\n\n[https:\/\/wallethacks.com\/average-median-income-in-america\/](https:\/\/wallethacks.com\/average-median-income-in-america\/)\n\nThis website (however accurate it is), says that the 60th percentile makes above (or 40% makes below) $20,000 a year.

Intuition says not as many as we have people. I really haven't looked into it as much. I personally have a feeling though that automation is going to be a huge societal force that we need to start looking towards before it just completely eats up jobs. In an extreme matter, what do we want our society to look like in a world where 90% of available jobs are being done by machines? I don't know, maybe we won't get there, maybe we will. But at the rate we are moving now I feel like we need to support the folks who have lost their jobs in the short run for sure, but also need to start looking forward at the possibility that there may simply just not be that many jobs left in the future in general. Theoretically, if we have machines that can do any manufacturing job, any service job, then what's left? \n\nI will say that while in absolute terms about manufacturing production that it hasn't decreased, the jobs definitely have decreased, I think the main point I wanted to make about that is that a large part of the reason jobs are decreasing is due to technological advances, not just offshoring per se. I'm not quite sure what you mean by the 1% selling us out, but I think its more of the fact that in countries such as China there are simply less regulations and so they have much cheaper labor. That's part of the reason there's such a huge knockoff market in China, because of their lack of IP laws. In a global economy it's hard to fight off the movement of industry to places where it's cheaper, and that's part of the tradeoff in engaging in more efficient trade. That's where the argument for tariffs come in, the tradeoff there is that we can keep some jobs in the states, but at the price of much more expensive goods.\n\nRegarding the fact that we have plenty of bartenders with BA degrees, I was skeptical about that but to my surprise found an article from 2012 that said that about 12% of bartenders indeed have BA degrees, I'm sure the number has increased as well in the last 6 years. I feel like that is primarily due to a transition in higher education, where a 4 year degree is becoming more and more equivalent to what a high school degree used to be. On one hand its good because having a higher educated population, no matter what job they end up doing, has plenty of societal benefits (decreased crime rates, increased voter participation, etc.). On the other hand, these degrees are much much more expensive than high school diplomas in the US. \n\nSo where does that leave us? Do we continue to try and recuperate jobs that used to exist, do we provide easier access to bachelors degrees and let people work jobs they are overqualified for, do we begin to consider more dramatic solutions to the problem of automation such as a Universal Basic Income? I don't really know.\nI'm just an undergrad so I'm sure I have my fair share of biases, so please take what I say with a grain of salt.

Apparently, a lot of employers do too. \n\nI am not a proponent of pure capitalism. I've said throughout this thread I support smart regulation and safety nets. This is more akin to the hybridized system we have today. Capitalism has its benefits, no matter how much you try to demonize it. And those benefits are that it allows (when appropriately regulated) social mobility, more equal opportunities, an incentive to work, and an incentive to innovate. We don't have Lords or Kings or a totally nationalized economy. Capitalism has a lot of excellent qualities. \n\nEven the Nordic countries operate on a capitalistic society. They do pay high taxes, and they do have lots of wonderful social services, but they are still a hybridized capitalistic society. And you said their economies are the ones you want to emulate. So how bad can capitalism be?\n\nThese are not \"ideological\" arguments. This is fact, verifiable by anyone. You may misunderstand my facts, but it doesn't change anything. You just need some real world experience\/understanding.\n\n&gt; Really, your arguments are largely value based. \n\nYours are **completely** based off of small studies and idealistic thinking, which has never manifested itself in any recorded point in society. \n\nProve me wrong... show me any point in time where society was operating optimally.\n\n&gt; While you raise good points at times to my arguments....I have to ask...do you have any EVIDENCE for your arguments? It's easy to expect me to do most of the work while asking me questions based on unsupported ideas, but honestly, if you want me to dignify your questions, I kind of have to expect you to do your own homework here too.\n\nI provide as much evidence as I possibly can. \nYou would understand a lot more of my anecdotes if you had more life experience, but I have no control over that. You have to take my word for it, but at least I call it like it is.\n\nYour studies are weak and shouldn't be misconstrued as evidence, as almost all of the variables are drastically different. Especially when you misrepresent them like you have. I said UBI would reduce work efforts, then you posted a study that concluded the same thing, yet are using it against my argument? Come on now...\n\n&gt; When saying people will misuse the money, that they won't work, that they will commit more crimes, that they'll have more kids, etc., what basis do you make these accusations? Do you have any EVIDENCE for them? \n\nMaybe some exists, but I don't have any direct evidence. The important thing about why I bring this issues up is not if I have evidence, though. It's a matter of if they are real risks that can carry real consequences, and the answer is YES. They may not happen, but like I said before, I'd rather prepare for the worst than hope for the best.\n\nRemember, you don't have any evidence of what they will do, either. It's all speculation based on small studies, that may not even be real indicators of what will happen if UBI is implemented permanently, and on a national scale. But your idea doesn't prepare for the risks involved. So if your plan is implemented, and the risk do come to fruition, you're fucked. That's not a well thought-out plan, \"evidence\" or not.\n\n&gt; Keep your \"experience\" out of the equation here...engage in the sociological imagination (try to relate your experiences to what goes on, on the larger scale). \n\nKeep your experience out of the equation...try to relate your experiences...\n\nWait, what?\n\n&gt; Do you have evidence of significant abuse of the system? I don't deny abuse exists, but the statistics show it's actually low, and the majority of people DO NOT abuse the system.\n\nDo I need evidence if you already have it? Why wouldn't you share it for the sake of a thorough, honest discussion? It seems like a cheap shot for you to say \"where's the evidence\" and \"i don't deny it exists\" in the same breath. Are you trying to figure out the best solution to the problem, or \"win\" the argument?\n\n&gt; That being said, saying we shouldn't establish whole programs because of a minority of abusers is unfair to the people who do need help. You keep saying that I don't have responses to all of these \"problems\" as you put them...but maybe, that's because I don't recognize that these so called problems exist, at least on a large scale. The data, to my knowledge, isn't there.\n\nI'm not saying we should deny whole programs. I'm saying we should deny programs that don't carry an underlying incentive to work. Welfare is temporary. UBI is not. HUGE difference. I'm not against all social programs. Don't be sneaky and try to lump them all together. \n\n&gt; You can criticize my sources all you want, but honestly, if you don't put forth any effort to actually justify your preconceptions, then your arguments really aren't worth considering.\n\nExcept I have. Even the underlying risk is a reality to consider, yet you completely ignore it.\n\nSay it might rain today. Do you take an umbrella or not? Which is worse, having an umbrella and no rain, or having rain and no umbrella?\n\nPrepare for the worst, or you're just asking to get wet.\n\n&gt; Especially given your entire argument has a a highly pro capitalistic slant\n\nCapitalism isn't bad if it's regulated well. You seem to have a grudge with capitalism regardless.. maybe you are the one injecting the bias into the argument? \n\nBesides, what's the anti-capitalist slant? Communist\/marxist? Is that what you're advocating for?\n\n&gt; and seems to abide by the ideological bias of the republican party.\n\nIf you say so.... lol... if you only knew....","labels":"a"},{"text":"For starters, don't make people choose between their welfare benefits  and UBI\n\nIf a person who isn't currently on foodstamps could use another 1k a month no questions asked, a person who is currently on foodstamps could also certainly use another 1k a month no questions asked, while keeping their food stamps.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Means testing and temporary stimulus checks is not UBI.\n\nDon't get it confused.","labels":"n"},{"text":"&gt; You seem to think that if Universal Basic Income would be implemented the money would somehow go somewhere. \n\n&gt;The money isn't being \"spent\", it's not disappearing - it's in the hands of prospective consumers. \n\nBut opportunity cost is a major factor in economics, and leaving it out of the discussion is a bit disingenuous. \n\nThe money you are giving to give to consumers has to come from wealth creators (companies, investments, income earners, etc).

Most people who call themselves libertarians don\u2019t believe in privatizing the police force, abolishing the FDA, or completely getting rid of food safety regulations.

A carbon tax is liked by many to curtail emissions and provide a tax base. Smarter spending in ways like ending the drug war and taxing legal marijuana could provide a portion of the needed revenue. Simply having higher taxes on the wealthiest in the nation is likely to be needed as well. The thought is seeing a dramatic income raise for the bottom ~75% of the population is worth seeing the absolute wealthiest in society see less wealth. Basic income allows us to cut back on much of the spending already happening for welfare services that would become redundant. \n\nThe theory also holds that in the long run we will see dramatic savings. This is from having a substantially healthier population, more opportunities and financial security for people to become more educated or to sharpen their skills for a job they would like. The theory holds that we would likely be more economically productive in the form of seeing the work that is done be more suited to human needs and wants than what is available now. \n\nAgain, it won't be the easiest thing in the world to find a way to best fund and implement basic income, but it is a topic that should be looked at as a serious option to help our troubled society and economy.

That stabilizes the dollar and auto regulates the deficit.","labels":"a"},{"text":"With a basic income, there's less incentive to work, thus less tax revenue, thus no way to sustain the basic income, thus the economy collapses.\n\nUnless you have already created Cylons.

A slippery slope fallacy would have been if I suggested that if basic needs were given to people they would then eventually expand those basic needs to include weed and video games. \n\nSecondly, you shifted your terms. In your first post you say \"providing people with shelter, food and water\" and in your reply you shift to universal basic income. Those are not the same. The former requires actually ensuring each individual or family is provided with physical shelter(projects), food(2,000 calories is what you said), and clean drinking water whether they are deserving of it or not and whether they intend to work or not. And again, there are plenty of people who would live quite comfortably under those conditions, they yearn to be taken care of. Universal income is simply handing out money and hoping people use it the correct way.\n\nStockton is not a good example of universal basic income working. They gave money to 125 people out of a city of 300,000. That's precision targeted help, not even close to universal, and it could have been accomplished by a non-profit or community led initiative. The results may have been a slight net positive(if taken at face value without deeper examination) for that tiny group, which had to meet certain qualifications to be eligible, but that's hardly an endorsement of \"Universal\" basic income ala Andrew Yang. However, I am not opposed to experimenting with more targeted approaches to help small groups of people through temporary stipends if it provides results. Though again, better if it came from voluntary associations rather than coerced government funding.\n\nYou also attempt to characterize my argument, question, and concerns(which you don't even attempt to address) as \"the same argument that conservatives in Congress spout about welfare\" and then list some stats about fraud, even though I never mentioned fraud. Though we certainly can talk about some of the recent scandals, like the Mississippi welfare fraud scandal ongoing or the $11-$20 billion in unemployment fraud scandal in California. I don't know if that qualifies as \"ENORMOUS\" to you but that's not chump change. These scandals are not an isolated incident, they continually crop up.\n\nMy particular concern was more about people who choose to live off of welfare more than people illegally selling food stamps. Welfare was designed to help people temporarily, but many people see it as being owed to them or simply a means to live off of rather than a boost to self-sufficiency. Some women will continuously have children in order to receive welfare checks, rather than attempt to form some sort of cohesive household. Some of welfare's requirements incentivize women to not have two parent households which lead to lower income and generational wealth. Now, none of that is fraud but it isn't healthy for society, the economy, or the children in those families and there's very little oversight.","labels":"a"},{"text":"&gt; Many are middle aged or older and just living in the woods. 30 years ago, there was more of a relaxed hippie vibe, now it is more desperation and addiction.\n\nI was responding to peanuts_abc.\n\nAs for millennials... well they have their entire life ahead of them. and there is no reason why a millennial should be considering Universal basic income.\n\nyoung people need to work to develop character, personality and life experience. \n\nI just don't pay attention to what mega millions think the rest of society should do with themselves.

The early studies were carried out by several physicians in USA and published in the American Journal of Surgery. However with the development of antibiotics, the use of UBI declined and it has now been called \u201cthe cure that time forgot\u201d. Later studies were mostly performed by Russian workers and in other Eastern countries, and the modern view in Western countries is that UBI remains highly controversial. This review discusses the potential of UBI as an alternative approach to current methods used to treat infections, as an immune-modulating therapy and as a method for normalizing blood parameters. Low and mild doses of UV kill microorganisms by damaging the DNA, while any DNA damage in host cells can be rapidly repaired by DNA repair enzymes. However the use of UBI to treat septicemia cannot be solely due to UV-mediated killing of bacteria in the bloodstream, as only 5\u20137% of blood volume needs to be treated with UV to produce the optimum benefit, and higher doses can be damaging. There may be some similarities to extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) using psoralens and UVA irradiation. However there are differences between UBI and ECP in that UBI tends to stimulate the immune system, while ECP tends to be immunosuppressive. With the recent emergence of bacteria that are resistant to all known antibiotics, UBI should be more investigated as an alternative approach to infections, and as an immune-modulating therapy.\n&gt;","labels":"n"},{"text":"$1000 is a somewhat arbitrary number, but it is around the poverty line (which is much better than $0\/month) and it is based on some of the UBI research that has been going on for awhile.

This is so much more effective and cheaper than treatment once something is full blown. \n\n* Societal models of prevention can include: universal basic income projects, housing projects, screenings (like for cervical cancer or prostate cancer - physicians can be trained to do basic screens for emerging mental health issues), de-stigmatization programs so folx talk more about their issues, green spaces, focus on being physically active, ensuring government policy promotes good maternity leave and vacation\/sick leave, easy access to mental health care (like the bounce back ontario initiative), and access through EAP programs at work places). \n\n\nThe trouble is that mental health issues are so personal and so complex. Two people may have identical relatioship issues, but one is resilient in the face of it while for the other it sparks a major depressive episode that starts a cascade of mental health issues. It's too difficult to tell, so it's better to treat everyone who needs it.  This is what makes mental health different than say a bone fracture. 9\/10 times the treatment for a broken leg will be the same where as 10\/10 times, the treatment for a difficult couple relationship will be different.\n\nUltimately, on the budget side, the hope would be those trying to skim the system are cheaper than the problem we have now which is thousands of people homeless or in psychiatric emerge or in crisis care centres, or on OASW or ODSP because they didn't have adequate support up front.

Not sure exactly what it would be, but it would be a good portion of what it takes to raise a kid to adulthood.\n\nMaybe that is $200k.  You have to come up with $200k, or a certified bond agent willing to post that sum for you if you flake out.  Presumably that bond agent or anybody loaning you the money will extract their profits or otherwise take measures to deter flakiness.  If you paid cash then you probably are responsible enough to not flake out, and if you do, well, we have your cash.\n\nEvery year the required bond would drop by $10k.  You'd get a check back from the government for that amount.  You could use it however you wanted to, or if this was funded by a loan you could use it for repayment.  If you had a bond agent then the agent would be relieved of that portion of their obligation.  When the kid turns 18 you'd get whatever is left returned.  If you flake out you forfeit the bond, and if there is a bond agent they have to pay up on your behalf.\n\nNow, there are all kinds of variations on this.  One that I think is interesting is what I'd call \"libertarian UBI.\"  Instead of a $200k bond you pay a $600k UBI fee to have a child.  That fee goes into a big fund, and for the rest of their life the kid gets $20k\/yr inflation-adjusted, payable to the parents until they're 18.

I'm not here to promote libertarianism as a ideal that we strive for, I'm here to promote it as a functional system.\n\n&gt;UBI reduces the size of necessary government\n\nNo it doesn't, first of all you will never convince any person within government to promote something like this and at the same time take out other government systems. Ubi is meant to be a supplemental income to cover the bases in which other forms of welfare might miss, not a catch-all solution to the problem.\n\n&gt;and gives more people the economic freedom to decide where their money is spent\n\nThis is why I don't call you a Libertarian, there's no such thing as economic freedom. To imply that people have an entitlement to resources undermines the very idea of what libertarianism is. It undermines the basic structure and throws it to the wind, you cannot support this and support natural rights. If you don't support natural rights then you basically throw out everything that is libertarian. And I'm not here, as I said before, to promote this as some idealism of libertarianism. Natural rights as a system of government enforcement is much more practical than what you're suggesting. You can't have it both ways, and that's why I'm saying this solution is bad.\n\nPart of the issue here is that I feel as though you don't understand what you're asking for, it's sort of like people who haven't really looked at the structures being fed this ideal version of them would promote them without really understanding The Logical consequences of it. The law is not something to be played with, we have to be very careful how we Implement laws and arguments into the system. Any arguments that we promote now we have to support later. And if the argument is that people deserve resources because that makes them free, you will eventually have to justify that within the rest of the system. Thus eliminating natural rights as a consequence. The two are irreconcilable oh, you can't believe that people have a right to other people's Resorts has without also saying that the other people that you are taking resources from don't have a right to their resources. And promoting this idea as though it were a practical solution is a huge problem because what it entails is the elimination of the very thing we're supposed to be fighting for.\n\n&gt;as opposed to all the current government handouts that are earmarked for specific expenses (section 8, food stamps, utility assistance - each along with its own bureaucracy). \n\nThe other problem with this is that it misunderstands the fundamental problem of these systems. The reason why these systems don't work isn't the fact that the systems are wrong, it's that the underlying logic is wrong. If you put forward an idea that does not match reality it will not function correctly. By introducing Ubi you do not solve the problem, you actually ignore a fundamental issue that we have yet to come up with a proper solution for. With technology becoming more and more advanced we are finding that people are less and less relevant to society, this isn't just a problem of poverty though this is a problem of psychology. You might think that if you just provide people with income you might solve this problem, this is the line of reasoning of socialists, which is why I don't view you as a Libertarian. And the reason why that never works is because the idea that it's based on, the fundamental presuppositions and arguments in favor of these things are wrong, when you implement these things you have to be able to justify them within reality or else when you implement them they don't function correctly. And that's because you could imagine that if you design a machine and it doesn't reflect what is physically possible to make in the world you can't actually make it. And instead if you do make something that kind of resembles it it isn't going to function because what you had designed is not the same as what you're putting into reality.\n\nThe last problem I want to bring up is the actual problem that you're trying to solve, which is poverty in a world where human beings are less and less relevant. I don't have a solution for you, it's too complicated of a problem and nobody knows how to fix it because not only are we not actually experiencing the problem yet, and trust me you think this is all bad just wait another 20 to 50 years, it's going to get a lot worse. We haven't really put our minds to the issue, and I can't see a solution to the problem right now, but I know that this isn't going to solve anything in fact it's going to make things worse. If we promote this as a solution it's not going to solve the underlying psychological issues of the citizens not having purposes in life and just living off of the state. Now you might want to deny this and say well people don't actually need work, they don't actually need a purpose within Society they can just ignore it. That's a problem of your personality reflecting the solution that you see, and that's the issue is that your personality isn't the same as every other person in society. One of the things that I've done is tried to study psychology because I believe that this is a real problem, and one of the things that I found through my studies is that personality is a huge factor in issues like this. People differ on conscientiousness so vastly, and openness as well, that what would sustain one person is completely different from what would sustain another person. People who are high in openness and low in conscientiousness are going to come up with Solutions like this, they're going to say well if we just have the resources to do whatever the hell we want then things will be fine. And I can see the benefits of that because if everybody was like that then yes this solution that you're coming up with would work, but not everybody is like that, in fact the vast majority of people are not like that. It's a very small minority in which this solution would actually work. And even then I don't even think it's a good solution for the people who have high openness, low conscientiousness, even if you are very low in conscientiousness you still need a purpose in life, will lead to depression if you don't give yourself things that you strive for. And the problem is that if there is no benefit to you doing anything within society given this post human labor market you're going to develop things like chronic pain, depression, addictions, a number of different issues will come about because of it.\n\nAlthough I haven't spent as much time as I'd like to on this problem, it's always been one in the back of my mind, and through my studies and University I found a lot of frightening things about people and where we're going with this whole technological Revolution. This isn't the same as the previous ones, we're not just going to find new jobs, we're not just going to fix it with you bi or some other similar welfare program, we're heading for a Judge Dread style dystopia where nobody really works everybody's really depressed and drug-addicted and we don't know what to do with our lives. And what that's going to end up doing is leading to a revolution, and I don't know who's going to be at the top of that but they're not going to be very nice people.\n\nI know this is a long post, it's a very complicated issue and I wish I could do it better Justice, but I can't cuz this isn't a paper, this is a comment on Reddit. And I want you to understand that there are several issues about this solution that you are trying to implement that you haven't considered. Many times we will run into problems and think there's a really simple solution that if we just did this thing everything will go away, but the problem is that reality is way too complicated, and solutions that you try to implement that involve society as a whole will not only often not solve the problem that you're trying to solve, you won't even know what it does. This is something that any social scientist should understand from the get-go, anything you try to do on a mass scale just doesn't work. You can't Puppeteer Society, it's not something that you have the ability to do. You will Overlook things you will not consider other issues you will view things from a singular dimension. Imagine a one-dimensional ant being on a four dimensional cube the size of the planet do you think that ant is going to be able to do anything productive with that Cube? Not really, it's too vast, it's changing constantly, its it's a completely different monster, a three-dimensional Cube would be just as difficult, it would be nearly impossible and that's without it changing all the time. But the surface changes, things move, and the Beast that you're trying to Wrangle with is more likely to eat you than it is to bow in submissiveness towards you. Its  too complicated, we're human beings, not Gods, we can do really amazing things with really simple things but when we're talking about humanity is a whole it's just too complicated for us and we need to implement very very specific solutions to very very specific problems rather than trying to implement Broad and sweeping solutions to these vast problems that we don't even know how to comprehend at the moment.","labels":"a"},{"text":"- A major breakthrough in cancer cure\n\n- 4k VR is now accessible\n\n- UBI gets implemented somewhere","labels":"n"},{"text":"&gt; But now millions of people who are on hourly wages are at risk of losing their source of income, paycheck to paycheck adults will suffer, and many will lose their health insurance.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\nAlmost like we need Universal Basic Income and Universal Healthcare.","labels":"s"},{"text":"I'm LDS, I'm a socialist (or at least a social democrat), and I think Basic Income is an ideal solution to replace most of our existing social welfare programs.

I agree. Whether you think that's a great idea or not, or whether you can imagine a better system, doesn't matter; it's what *is.*  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Why isn't there Commons where I can gather and forage and plant wild rice today?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelieve it or not, I think it's a pity that isn't available. I ALSO think there isn't a snowflake's chance in hell of it becoming available in your lifetime, mine, or that of our grandchildren. It is what it is. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTry it this way: we don't get to choose the era we're born into, or the circumstances. All we can do is grab life by the balls and get the most we can out of what's available to us at the moment. I had an interesting conversation a couple of weeks back with a young man who graduated from medic school with me last month. He's a black guy from a shit neighborhood, and he applied for a grant from the workforce center to pay for his training. He talked about the things he wants for himself, his wife, and his young son, which are mostly the same things the people he grew up with want. What he said was frustrating to him, looking at his childhood friends (many of whom are in jail or working dead-end jobs), is that these things are AVAILABLE. But you have to get the fuck up and take it.\n\nThis applies to anything, including all the various forms of dropping out. I don't think anybody is likely to just GIVE you the money to drop out; things have to get much worse than they are before even a token UBI becomes a reality. Dropping out has to be earned. The good news? I've done it, and it's not that fucking hard. It's mostly a matter of opportunism. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere's a whole world of shit out there that you can have, more than enough to compensate for the things you can't have. But you can't get married to a specific vision. One must be opportunistic, and learn to say it is what it is and mean it.","labels":"a"},{"text":"As an accelerationist, I love UBI","labels":"s"},{"text":"I'm looking through the AMA.

If you know that you're only *really* making a dollar or two an hour, because you're effectively losing 80% of your wage in benefit clawbacks, there is a real incentive not to work - if you can't cover travel expenses, etc., not to mention that it might be much easier not to. Say your benefits are $1000\/month, but once you make external income over 20% of your benefits, the benefits get clawed back by 80%. If you get a side gig for 10 hours a week at $10, which should earn you an extra $400, you *actually* only end up with $1080, because most of what you earned was taken back away from you.\n\nWith a *guaranteed* minimum\/basic income, that *cannot* be clawed back, the incentive to work is not removed. Say you could get that same $1000\/month as a basic income, no questions asked, no clawbacks period. With that same side gig for 10 hours a week at $10\/hour, you can increase your income - and therefore your standard of living - by 40%, to $1400. That's the difference (depending on your local cost of living) between a small room in a shared apartment and basic, basic groceries, and a studio apartment, better food, and a few bucks a month to throw into a savings account.

Or that, in 1968, the year of his assassination, King had planned a [Poor People's March on Washington](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Poor_People%27s_Campaign) in support of economic justice for all. The broader economic aspect of the civil rights movement, and the ideas of class and racial solidarity that accompanied it, has been largely omitted in popular teachings and culture.\n\nOne of the key demands at the March on Washington was a $2\/hr minimum wage, which would be [~$18\/hr when adjusted for inflation](https:\/\/i.redd.it\/dowv4x97ep981.png). Instead, our federal minimum wage is $7.25\/hr. National inflation adjustment isn't perfect, as different locales have experienced different cost increases, and many necessity costs, such as healthcare and housing, have outpaced inflation, however it does speak volumes that even a somewhat conservative adjustment of the $2\/hr minimum wage would be $18\/hr today.\n\nYesterday politicians that vehemently oppose a $15\/hr minimum wage (and other forms of economic justice) posted tributes to MLK, claiming to support him, when they likely would have vilified him if they were around in the 60s and they definitely do not represent a modern version of King's anti-racist, anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist views.\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nI highly recommend reading \"A Freedom Budget for All Americans\", which was an economic plan constructed by economists and activists in the mid-late 60s.\n\n&gt; In the fall of 1965, after the Voting Rights Act passed, the coalition of black, socialist, and progressive leaders who had come together to organize 1963\u2019s March on Washington joined together again to create an ambitious policy document with no less a goal than ending poverty in the United States without cost to taxpayers. First released in 1966, it proposed using strong economic growth to provide a federal jobs guarantee, universal health care, and a basic income. This executive summary of the full report, published in 1967, was endorsed by more than 100 signatories and was distributed in black neighborhoods. \n\nHere is the introduction from A. Philip Randolph, one of the key figures in the Freedom Budget:\n\n&gt; INTRODUCTION\n\n&gt; I believe, and profoundly hope, that from this day forth the opponents of social progress can take comfort no longer, for not since the March on Washington has there been such broad sponsorship and enthusiastic support for any undertaking as has been mobilized on behalf of \u201cThe Freedom Budget for All Americans.\u201d\n\n&gt; These forces have not come together to demand help for the Negro. Rather, we meet on a common ground of determination that in this, the richest and most productive society ever known to man, the scourge of poverty can and must be abolished\u2014not in some distant future, not in this generation, but within the next ten years!\n\n&gt; The tragedy is that the workings of our economy so often pit the white poor and the black poor against each other at the bottom of society. The tragedy is that groups only one generation removed from poverty themselves, haunted by the memory of scarcity and fearful of slipping back, step on the fingers of those struggling up the ladder.\n\n&gt; And the tragedy is that not only the poor, the nearly poor, and the once poor, but all Americans, are the victims of our failure as a nation to distribute democratically the fruits of our abundance. For, directly or indirectly, not one of us is untouched by the steady spread of slums, the decay of our cities, the segregation and overcrowding of our public schools, the shocking deterioration of our hospitals, the violence and chaos in our streets, the idleness of able-bodied men deprived of work, and the anguished demoralization of our youth.\n\n&gt; For better or worse, we are one nation and one people. We shall solve our problems together or together we shall enter a new era of social disorder and disintegration.\n\n&gt; What we need is an overall plan of attack.\n\n&gt; This is what the \u201cFreedom Budget\u201d is. It is not visionary or utopian. It is feasible. It is concrete. It is specific. It is quantitative. It talks dollars and cents. It sets goals and priorities. It tells how these can be achieved. And it places the responsibility for leadership with the Federal Government, which alone has the resources equal to the task.\n\n&gt; The \u201cFreedom Budget\u201d is not a call for a handout. It is a challenge to the best traditions and possibilities of America. It is a call to those who have grown weary of slogans and gestures to rededicate themselves to the cause of social reconstruction. It is a plea to men of good will to give tangible substance to long-proclaimed ideals.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2018\/02\/a-freedom-budget-for-all-americans-annotated\/557024\/\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/A_Freedom_Budget_for_All_Americans\n\nFor a more radical look at King's work, check out the book The Radical King, which is a collection of King's writings edited by Cornel West:\n\n&gt; \u201cThe radical King was a democratic socialist who sided with poor and working people in the class struggle taking place in capitalist societies. . . . The response of the radical King to our catastrophic moment can be put in one word: revolution\u2014a revolution in our priorities, a reevaluation of our values, a reinvigoration of our public life, and a fundamental transformation of our way of thinking and living that promotes a transfer of power from oligarchs and plutocrats to everyday people and ordinary citizens. . . . Could it be that we know so little of the radical King because such courage defies our market-driven world?\u201d \u2014Cornel West, from the Introduction\n\n&gt; Every year, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is celebrated as one of the greatest orators in US history, an ambassador for nonviolence who became perhaps the most recognizable leader of the civil rights movement. But after more than forty years, few people appreciate how truly radical he was.\n\n&gt; Arranged thematically in four parts, The Radical King includes twenty-three selections, curated and introduced by Dr. Cornel West, that illustrate King\u2019s revolutionary vision, underscoring his identification with the poor, his unapologetic opposition to the Vietnam War, and his crusade against global imperialism. As West writes, \u201cAlthough much of America did not know the radical King\u2014and too few know today\u2014the FBI and US government did. They called him \u2018the most dangerous man in America.\u2019 . . . This book unearths a radical King that we can no longer sanitize.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/www.penguinrandomhouse.com\/books\/239755\/the-radical-king-by-martin-luther-king-jr-cornel-west\/","labels":"s"},{"text":"No he makes a very good point.

Firms don't give a shit, they'll prefer it even.

What prevents firms from using predatory business practices to destroy each other? They want to get to the point is where all markets are run by monopolies and oligopolies who create fake barriers to entry and suppress all competition. That's how they'll maximize shareholder value after all. Who disseminates accurate and unbiased information to the public when information itself is a commodity? Media firms can gain huge amounts of power and money by withholding some info while strategically distributing other info.\n\nAn unregulated free market is an unstable state.

That is, not with a universal \"flat fee\", but with spending dependent on the condition (usually meaning: lots of resources going towards people with the worst, most expensive conditions, and few resources going towards healthy people who don't need them).  Almost every developed country in the world except America has a universal healthcare system that does this, and produces better actual health and quality of life outcomes (across the board, even for the most wealthy).  \n\n&gt; pitch UBI as a replacement for all welfare programs\n\nUBI is not a replacement for all programs of all types.  It is not a replacement for appropriate health-related spending, as talked about above (Some people need significantly more support, some less, and countries can still provide that *and* produce better outcomes for everyone.  How?  Because universal healthcare systems do things like [pool risk](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Risk_pool), negotiate prices against monopolist drug companies (monopolist through pharmaceutical IP law) and locally monopolistic hospitals, etc., the kinds of things which result in huge increases in efficiency of the human workforce, who are healthier and freed up to actually be productive instead of having to do things like: negotiate as individuals with effectively no [bargaining power](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bargaining_power) for their lives against these monopolists the moment a person develops a healthcare issue).  \n\n&gt; I find it immoral to suddenly take those who are unable to care for themselves and expect them to interact with the economy in the same nature.  \n\nI agree.  Not only is it immoral (if that weren't enough), setting up a system that does this turns out to be *less efficient* for everyone involved.  Fundamentally putative, benefit-*denying* welfare systems turn out to hurt *everyone* in the end, because they produce less efficient workforces (which you can see *for both healthcare AND income support programs* in, for example, the Scandinavian social safety nets).  \n\n^ The same argument can be used to defend a UBI, and a UBI that doesn't replace the kinds of costs UBI *isn't designed to address*.  \n\n------\n\n&gt; Are there any instances where UBI studies have dealt with this question?\n\nUnfortunately, no.  A lot of UBI studies so far have been done in developing countries (because the cost of income experiments will be lower there, because income is lower there).  Unfortunately, a lot of these locations don't have adequate (or any) healthcare welfare in place (or even adequate or any private healthcare services, at all), so the UBI pilots don't involve taking that money.  \n\nPractically all of the ones that took place in developed countries were funded from outside sources anyway, so, again, that's a reason why local health expenditure was not going to be directed towards the UBI.  \n\n---------\n\nThere are some results that may be of interest to you, even if they do not have to do with answering the question of \"Does replacing healthcare spending with a UBI ruin a UBI's effectiveness for the most vulnerable?\"  \n\nBoth of these examples, to be clear, do not involve replacing healthcare expenditure with a UBI, and are not relevant to that question.  \n\nBut I would like to present two examples showing that a UBI funded independently has some positive effect on health outcomes.   \n\nThe first is the Uttar Pradesh\/UNICEF\/SEWA income experiments, which found that spending on medicine spontaneously increased. Another potentially interesting result of this experiment was that some of the most vulnerable members of the community (the disabled and elderly) reported almost a *change in culture*, wherein they described a sense of being respected, included, and as \"having value\" in a way that wasn't happening before.  \n\nThe second would be the Manitoba, Canada Mincome experiments, analyzed by economist Dr. Evelyn Forget.  One of the unexpected things Forget found resulting from this very modest income program was a small decrease in hospital visits coinciding with the period of the program.  \n\nSo UBI does have a minor positive effect on healthcare outcomes alone, but the nature of health problems \n\n(high unequal: here in the US we have ~50% of the population spends almost nothing, and the 'top' 5% of the population spends 50% of the total) \n\nmeans that a \"flat rate\" UBI given to all would *not* be an appropriate tool for addressing health issues.  The structure of UBI isn't designed for that problem and imho shouldn't be used for it.  It should be used only for more universal income support needs.

They're full of requirements and means testing and income limits and they tell you how to spend the money and are constantly breathing down your neck. \n\nAnd despite them constantly harassing you to get a job, they tend to have steep cliffs that stop people from getting out of poverty because it can be more profitable to remain on welfare than to accept a pay raise or work more hours or get a better job.\n\n&gt;It helps people live.\n\nRelative to literally nothing, sure.

At the same time, unless you really go the whole unconditional no strings attached route, then those programs can be sabotaged. Even a poorly done UBI can be sabotaged. Like I dislike the NIT\/tax credit approach to UBI. Too easy to add job requirements and means testing to exclude people. \n\n&gt; We need universal programs with no means testing.\n\nno crap, what do you think UBI is?\n\n&gt;UBI is a cool idea on top of that, but not instead of welfare. \n\nWhy not? Outside of a handful of programs like medicare for all, free college and maybe some childcare\/housing stuff, I dont see a need for much else. maybe keep some level of social security around to top off seniors, but that's also cash. I dont see a problem with cash. Thats where i differ from socialists and welfarists. I understand the need for additional programs that address market failures, but if cash works, I believe cash is better. Better to let people figure out for themselves what they need than a government telling them what they get. You let the government decide what food you get too and you get stuff like cheese sitting out in the hot sun and gruel, and if you want better you gotta get a \"real job.\" That's kinda what i mean by controlling. The government is so paternalistic to poor people and what it dishes out to them is often the rejected stuff no one wants. You might wanna look into the tyranny of kindness by theresa funiciello for more on that. It's so easy if you let the government control the goods and services directly that they'll use their power to be patronizingly paternalistic to the poor under the idea that they're too stupid to know what they want for themselves or they wouldnt be in this situation. And I could see a government being intentionally cruel to the poor, much like our current government is, to make them so miserable they'd rather sell themselves into wage slavery because at least then they'd control their own finances. \n\n&gt; This fantasy that people will be happy and say \u201ci guess id rather take the 1000 a month over this benefit because ill be more free and wont be dependent on the government!\u201d is not real outside of debate bro internet circles.\n\nUh, most progressive ideas are mostly held in debate bro circles. The normies are right wing and have a lot of the paternalistic and patronizing attitudes i described above.\n\nI understand i have a libertarian bend to my politics, as someone like say milton friedman would make the same arguments (I know, not the best example given how im trying to convince you we're not right libertarians but a broken clock is right twice a day, i'm a LEFT libertarian mostly), but yeah. It actually is a real position. And there is a lot of literature surrounding this. Most of the most successful programs have been cash. Child tax credit? Cash. Social security? Cash. Unemployment? Cash. The most \"deserving\" poor get cash. it's only the \"undeserving\" who get the paternalistic crap. UBI is intended to remove the stigma from welfare. And I think most people, maybe not all, but most people would rather have cash. \n\n&gt; Its a philosophical stance u have that was ingrained in you because we live under capitalism, you think depending on the government is bad and makes you weak or whatever nonsense.\n\nUh, projecting much?\n\nDepending on government isn't bad, but the difference is i dont want them controlling my life. UBI is the best of both worlds, breaking the whole dichotomy that exists in traditional politics between conservatives who believe in rugged individualism and \"freedom\" (their freedom is the right to serve or the right to starve in practice), and the idea that government programs are paternalistic. As you can tell I dont like the idea of people being dependent on wage labor either. And I believe most work relationships are quite tyrannical. I AM anti work after all. \n\nThe way I see it, I have nothing wrong with the government helping people, but I want them to otherwise interfere as little in their life as possible. Just give them the money and back off. Dont tell them how to spend it, dont act like they know what poor people want more than poor people, etc. Best of both worlds. \n\nI reject the idea of having a free market utopia with no government programs and us all being dependent on wage labor to survive.\n\nI reject the idea of an expansive and paternalistic leviathan that might provide for citizens, but does so in a bureaucratic, paternalistic way that leaves them unhappy and jumping through hoops and gives them inferior goods to live on. \n\nI want the best of both worlds, a government that is expansive and provides for people, but is as effective as possible in doing so, and largely stays out of peoples' lives. \n\nAgain, I'll never get how the left can seriously act like welfare is good vs a UBI. Maybe it's more generous, to certain people, in certain circumstances, but on the whole, no welfare sucks, the system is coercive, and the people on it arent treated like adults and given the freedom to run their own lives.\n\n&gt;We tax the rich to fund UBI and M4A and free college and a ton of other stuff, im sure they wont feel the missing 20 billion from their 100 billion and the billionaires sure don\u2019t deserve their wealth (im happy to go into that discussion).\n\nI'm neutral on the wealth of billionaires. Im not really gonna simp for jeff bezos saying he \"earned\" his $100 billion, but I'm not gonna be all eat the rich either. I'm fine with taxing them, but here's the thing. I've run the numbers. You cannot fund all of these programs just by taxing the rich. You need to have broad based taxation on everyone. \n\nUBI is $2.8-3.6 trillion a year\n\nMedicare for all is $1.75-2 trillion of additional spending a year (and retooling existing programs like medicare and medicaid)\n\nFree college\/student debt forgiveness is around $250 billion a year\n\nHousing can be up to $250 billion a year\n\nChildcare probably like $50 billion\n\nGreen new deal, bernie's iteration was $1.4 trillion if im not mistaken and i think the original version was something insane like $9-10 trillion a year.\n\nAll of these priorities cost money. And our entire economy is around $22 trillion. We spend around $6 trillion as is, meaning if we're gonna cap overall spending at roughly 50% of GDP like most social democracies do, we need to choose what priorities we deem important. We can only spend roughly $5 trillion more than we do. And this would raise tax rates significantly on everyone. my plans have the rich paying a 70% effective tax, which is the laffer curve maximum (revenue maximization), and the average citizen would still see 30-50% tax rates with this stuff. \n\nUltimately, we have to choose. And you wanna know what I chose? UBI, Medicare for all, free college. Those are my top 3 priorities. Bernie's agenda is good, but without UBi as a centerpiece i cant feel like the entire thing lacks something. You have all of these programs, but you still havent fixed what i consider to be the core issue with the economy, whcih is quite frankly how coercive it is. I also solve poverty with my ideas. I believe the bernie route could minimize or solve poverty, but it would still retain coercion as the government programs would still impose requirements on people, leave them poor if they dont work, etc., and honestly, I see work as it exists as a whole mess of coercion, and no, I dont believe socialism fixes that, just puts the same institution under new management.\n\n&gt;Also, i\u2019m not saying u have to agree with me 100% or leftists wont work with u. \n\nI hope not because that's the issue I have with most leftists thes days. Again, despite my criticisms of bernie I largely like him and believe he means well. But then his supporters will distrust me and call yang some techno libertarian who wants to destroy welfare or something. Again, already expressed my views on welfare, and I dont think we're really all that different, which is what frustrates me about that entire combative discussion.","labels":"s"},{"text":"I get the sentiment.

In other words, if you can replace 10 workers with a single worker, you don't just fire nine...you make your business 10x larger and more efficient so now you can employ *even more people*. We see this over and over in the economy.\n\n&gt;Trump diagnosed the problem correctly but didn't solve it. People are losing their jobs. He thought it was because of immigrants. He said he would create jobs. He failed.\n\nThis is all the opposite of true. The number of actual jobs available has been increasing and the unemployment rate has been decreasing ([source](https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/emp\/)). We're having *record* unemployment rates, especially for minority groups.\n\nNow, I'm not naive enough to pretend this is purely due to Trump's policy. And I agree job loss is not due to immigrants (illegal immigration is a problem for reasons other than occupational ones). But I can find *no* evidence whatsoever that we've been losing jobs in the economy. Even left-wing publications are not bold enough to blatantly lie about it.\n\n&gt;Andrew Yang came up with a wonderful solution: 1000$\/month to every American.\n\nI like Yang. I even think UBI is a good idea that won't work. It won't work not because of the principle involved but because of the reality of politics. Any entitlement you grant, whether it is UBI, social security, Medicare, welfare, etc. becomes a permanent fixture of the government and, more importantly, a tool for politicians to gain votes.\n\nIn other words, UBI relies on **disciplined** and careful use. The benefits are largely built into the simplicity, generality, and limitations inherent in the plan. Yang understands these implementation mechanisms. But the *second* it's actually implemented the next Democratic politician will just say \"Yang only gave you $1,000 a month. I'm offering $2,000 a month!\" And the next Republican politician will then say \"They are bankrupting the country with $2,000 a month. I'm going to limit UBI only to people making under $60k per year!\"\n\nAnd then you end up with welfare again. The benefits of UBI are gone because nobody really understood why it was a good idea in the first place (nor why welfare tends to be a *bad* idea).\n\nIn fact, it's exactly like Social Security; the original idea was to have a government-guaranteed 401k for all Americans. You paid in part of your check during your work, the government invested the pool of money, and you were paid back with interest when you retired. It's actually a good idea (and why 401k's and IRA's are fantastic investments).\n\nBut politicians got involved and now Social Security is paid out to people who haven't paid in. It's also paying out far more than the interest value of those who *did* pay in. And the pool of taxes being put into it is being used for other programs. Social Security is no longer a 401k...it's a ponzi scheme. And each new generation has to pay to support the old.\n\nIf UBI were implemented, do you think they'd actually *replace* welfare with it? Or Social Security? Or Medicare? Yeah, right. It would just be another taxation and redistribution system with all the inherent problems of our current ones.\n\nIn principle I support UBI. But in practice I think it's a terrible idea that cannot work. Humans simply don't have the discipline for it.","labels":"a"},{"text":"&gt;We shouldn\u2019t fetishize mom and pops.

Every UBI plan can be different in terms of amount or design.\nAndrew Yang is running for president as a Democrat in 2020 to implement a guaranteed income.

I could talk about the merits of valuing the collective and lower classes over the wealthy, but that's not where my focus is at.\n\nThe problem I see is that, in our current system, those with the means and capital seek to further enhance their capital. The largest costs to them would be the fact that they have to pay people for their labor. Since they have the capital to do so, then this wealthy class could begin to heavily invest in AI technologies that would remove the labor aspect (having to pay employees). This would put millions out of work, and since they've been kept on the lower end of paid positions, along with inflation and a stagnant minimum wage, this large lower class would not have the means to either reeducate themselves out of their station or find other low skill labor positions due to rapidly growing AI tech and automation.\n\nSo how do we solve this problem without impeding technological progression? In my opinion, create a new, publicly owned government branch using taxes that offers contracts to software\/hardware engineers. These contracts would stipulate that all proprietary software\/hardware developed using funding from these contracts would be sold back to the government. In turn, companies could rent out this tech thereby killing a job, but profits generated by this tech would go towards this government branch that each taxpayer would be a part of, kind of like being a stockholder. Finally, the revenue generated by this branch would fund public programs such as education, healthcare, UBI, etc.\n\nI don't think Communism could ever work and will never work without a fully automated labor force just because the disparities in labor generated by various sectors will always create feelings of resentment among the same class. However, the tech program I mentioned could be used as a transitional phase allowing us to branch off of the road I currently see us going down.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Media ruined politics and politics ruined every single other conversation there is.

Decentralized, more independent living where the bounty of robots can be had by most if not all. \n\nThe dystopian side is where a very few will figure out ways to charge rent on the critical aspects of life where a robot can't really help. Things like communications access, access to roads, access to government, access to healthcare, access to the banking system, property taxes, etc. \n\nI can see a situation where a person might get $30,000 per year in UBI in a society with few jobs. $10,000 will go to various unavoidable taxes and fees such as school fees. $5,000 will go to accessing communications. $5,000 for access to transport systems. And the remaining $10,000 plus will go to healthcare. I say plus because ideally everyone ends up in debt.\n\nI can see other situations such as access to raw materials for things like 3D printing will be heavily taxed. I can see a situation where even growing food is subject to taxes and fees. \n\nI can see a situation where you might want to live in the wild on some land your family owns. You can't build a house because conservation movements funded by developers have locked up all green land. If you somehow do get around this the local private utility will still be the only way you get water. You won't be allowed to go off grid or if you do then there will be \"generation\" taxes. If you try to grow your own food there will be inspections which you will probably fail and those inspections will cost money. Then there will be the fines. Jaywalking will be $700, this will be enforced by drones. Jaywalking would include just walking along the side of a highway. Getting in your self driven car will instantly start incurring road fees paid to the private owners of the road. \n\nNo matter which way people figure out how to break free of a monopoly or government tax it will simply be replaced with another. \n\nThere is a simple way to figure out which side of the fence various countries will end up on. That is how truly democratic they are. The question is a mathematical one. How many people does it take to elect a leader? For instance in most \"democracies\" it takes very very few to select those who will run and that leaves the \"voters\" a choice of just a few people. So if the rich elites on the left pick one and the rich elites on the right pick another then either way we vote the rich elites have won. \n\nProportional voting has similar problems. It is the rich elites an political insiders who pick the bevy of candidates. In theory this opens up the field to a wider variety of rich elites and insiders but still not a huge percentage of the population is involved in picking the leaders. More than in the FPTP party systems. \n\nCountries like Switzerland have something fairly close to actual democracies.\n\nUtopia to Dystopia will be proportional to the democracy to dictatorship measure.\n\nHere is what I would love to see in Canada with UBI. First the elimination of all political donations over $50. Proportional voting with proportional voting also being applied within the selection of party candidates. UBI that is sufficient to live on. UBI that cannot be taxed or garnished. Vastly increased referendums that are required to approve or can eliminate legislation or regulations. A moving UBI. That is a UBI bonus that if a person wants to move from one legal jurisdiction to another that they get this UBI bonus. This could be used once every 5 years or something.\n\nBut most importantly a wildly improved competition act. Something where if there aren't enough competitors for any given service or product that the taxes go through the roof on both profits and executive salaries. Thus owning the only toll road would simply be unprofitable. Also those taxes would be made available for the creation of competition. \n\nAny government service fee would have to only be large enough to cover the provable costs involve in that service. So a driver's license wouldn't be the near $100 but probably something closer to $10. The same with a toll road. If the road cost $1 million dollars per year including amortized costs then it would have no fee larger than 1 million divided by the number of users.\n\nThe idea is that no fee levied for one purpose could then go into a general budget. \n\nBut most importantly the number of government workers would be capped at a tiny tiny percentage of the population. Also the total salaries of these workers would also be capped at a tiny tiny percentage of the GDP. \n\nIn areas where localities could use their power to prevent change, I would like to see them lose their power. In areas where localities could compete, I would like to see them gain power. \n\nFor instance if you try to set up a small business in rural Nova Scotia the local municipality will suddenly insist that you follow the most modern fire, safety, health, and disability rules. Yet the same business owned by a friend of the town will follow none of the rules because they are \"grandfathered.\" If you manage to jump through those hoops, they will then change the street in front of your business to no-parking. If you survive that the volunteer fire marshal will find that you are a giant fire hazard and shut you down until you appeal.

Am I thereby a member of the \"capitalist class\"? How about my late uncle who co-owned an auto-body shop in South Jersey: he lived in a small house with his public school teacher wife worth maybe $200,000 in 2019. He and the guys at the shop sometimes hired high school kids to help sweep the shop up. Are these guys kith and kin with Andrew Carnegie? \n\n&gt; especially those who own that capital through state advantage, e.g. legalistic advantages through licensing, intellectual property and eminent domain.\n\nI see what you mean about licensing, but as I am sure you know, in the modern economy where labor unions have been decimated, licensing has exploded as a kind of replacement for unions. Licensing erects a barrier to entry for employment and thereby keeps the supply of labor low and wages high, because consumers have fewer alternatives for licensed services. In fact, if you Wiki up \"occupational licensing\" you'll see a great graph that shows the direct inverse relationship between the decline of unions and the rise of licensing. As unions go down, licensing goes up. \n\nAs far as IP I take your point, especially with prescription drug companies who tend to piggyback of National Institutes of Health research. I see no reason why this specific function shouldn't be socialized. But in the absence of any patent\/IP system whatsoever, what incentive would there be for research and development? If someone else will immediately be able to provide my new service at a lower cost (like Facebook with social media innovations), why should I even develop them in the first place? I'll put in the time and effort but won't make any money off it, and I'll take a loss. Now, this doesn't mean that IP rights should be *permanent*, and that's no the system that we have right now. After a certain period, IP rights expire altogether. The only place that I think this is a truly serious problem is with prescription drugs and other medical treatments. Although perhaps I am overlooking other issues here. \n\nI'm not sure what you mean with eminent domain. I understand the concept and anyone who has their real estate transferred via eminent domain will get fair market value for it. I disagree with the Kelo court's ideology that eminent domain should be available for non-state uses like casinos and industrial parks, but I think we're much better off in a world where we can build an interstate highway system or a rail line instead of letting someone hold up construction of things like that. \n\n&gt; I have a friend who owns some stock and yet is at the mercy of an awful job that he hates and only recently quit thanks to some savings, that is not a capitalist.\n\nThat's the definition of a capitalist, strictly speaking. He owns stock in a business corporation. That means he owns a share of the corporation. He gets to vote for the directors of the corporation. This is why I don't think this distinction makes any sense; ditto for the Retirement Fund example. These people own capital. They delegate management of the affairs of the corporation to a board of directors, who in turn delegate it further down the chain of command, especially when it comes to ordinary hiring and firing distinctions. The CEO of McDonald's and the Board of Directors of McDonald's do not make individual hiring and firing decisions on the ground level. \n\nIt seems to me that your problem is with *management,* not *capitalists*, and you've just latched onto the old Marxist jawn to describe something totally different. \n\n&gt; That is such an isolated idea of what profits actually look like that has no real bearing on our economy. When two people trade resources in a vacuum that is just a trade. But when someone makes money off another's labor without doing the work themselves and taking some of that money for themselves, that is the profit being discussed.\n\nIt's the same thing. I have something that Employer wants more than what he has (time and effort). Employer has something that I want more than what I have (money and benefits.) We trade what we have with each other because it's a good deal for both of us. What am I missing here? I think I understand your position but it just doesn't make any concrete sense. \n\nImagine I'm a construction worker. I get hired by a construction firm. They pay me money and maybe give me benefits, and I give them my time and effort in exchange. They are going to make money off of my labor (they think.) Would I have been able to make every cent of profit from my labor if I tried to shop my services to clients directly? I don't think so; my labor was actually only useful to someone and thus profitable because I was able to team up with an employer who hired a lot of other people and directed our labor in a way that resulting in something getting built. I couldn't have built it on my own and the client would not have hired me. To me, that sounds like a win for everyone: employer gets money, I get paid, and client gets their building. What am I missing? \n\n&gt;Oh Jesus. Come on, the failure of public defenders is so well known even liberals like John Oliver have tackled this (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=USkEzLuzmZ4). This is a side issue, but the fact that you have such little knowledge about how the justice system works is worrying.\n\nI think you're the one who doesn't understand how the legal system works because I was describing the process of (1) a *civil* lawsuit where (2) the employee would be the *plaintiff* (in other words, the person initiating the lawsuit) and the employer would be the defendant. If you don't understand something that basic, your legal analysis is not credible. \n\n&gt; Do you even see what you are writing? Do you think people from marginalized communities have the time or capital to file a lawsuit against someone who had a higher position of power over you to begin with?\n\nRemember what I said about how plaintiff's lawyers work on something called *contingency fees*? That means that they do *not* bill by the hour or charge a lump sum. Whether or not they get paid depends on whether or not they end up winning or settling their cases on behalf of their clients. It is set up that way *precisely* because prospective clients of plaintiffs lawyers generally do not have the money to pay up front but are willing to give up a slice of a damages award or settlement in order to pursue a lawsuit. Does that make sense? \n\n&gt; Why do you trust the authorities so much? If the authorities were such trustworthy folks, don't you think we would have a UBI already?\n\nYou're equivocating on what \"authorities\" means. The kinds of \"authorities\" who would arrest an employer who steals or makes physical threats against an employee are judges, juries, and attorneys. They are *not* the same people who decide whether or not America would have a UBI-based social safety net. That kind of thing is decide by the *legislature*, i.e. Congress.\n\nIf you've got enough evidence to bring a lawsuit, you can file it on a contingency (read: no money down, only pay if you win) basis and a judge (who is not financially interested in the outcome of the case) will get to decide if you've got enough evidence to proceed to discovery. You don't need to prove your case at this stage; discovery is about getting enough evidence to prove your case. You just need to plead enough facts so that you are plausibly entitled to relief. If your lawsuit is frivolous, it will get dismissed. If it has potential merit (not slam-dunk merit, just more than a scintilla of evidence to back it up) you get discovery. At this point your employer will probably already be interested in settling the case because discovery is a hideous b-i-t-c you-know-what of a process.  \n\n&gt; I've already discussed the dangers in my previous response but to sum them up: Sexual harassment, discrimination, emotional abuse, and physical harm in some extreme cases\n\nLawsuits get filed over these things *all the time.*","labels":"n"},{"text":"Would love to see who you depict as Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro, The Yung Turks, r\/basic income, r\/futurism, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and even Tucker Carlson.","labels":"n"},{"text":"The government does not in fact face a pension problem.

It\u2019ll be bad if it leads to just extraordinary wealth inequality, that we don\u2019t have the political or ethical will to fix.

I live in CA, close to SF, which has a very tight regulation and rent control, and it does not work because many people are homeless. We need more housings, not more tight control.  Not all landlords are bad and their goals are to invest their money. Rent control make many landlords losing money in SF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThree examples. A real estate agent told me his mom lived in SF for over 40 years, and her rent is still  $185 a month, that is due to rent control. In SF, most of one bedroom apartment cost over $2000 per month. The landlord can not raise the rent or move his mom out, I do not know why, but $185 40 years ago is very different from $200 now. So the landlord is losing money each month. It is not fair. A fair business should be win win for both parties, not one sided.\n\nThe second case was one Chinese lady subdivided her house to host many veterans at much below market value, veterans like it because the rent is low, but SF government does not like it because it violated its rule of square foot per person. The veterans were forced to move out to become homeless.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe third one is a Chinese woman again(Chinese people like to invest in real estate) rented out her apartments to four tenant families. They later found out that one of the unit was built without the permit. What the four tenant families do? They stopped paying rent for over a year, and at the same time suing the landlord for $20 millions for whatever bullish damage. Their claim was they might be physically harmed due to house was built without inspection. I gave this example just to show that not all tenants are wonderful. So always siding with \"poor working families\" against a business might not be reasonable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing for sure for me is that I would never invest in real estate in SF.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalifornia is known to have many tedious laws and rules. Right now every public building I entered will have a phrase outside saying that the building might have some substances cause cancer. What do I do? Dig a hole in my own soil?  but then the soil is contaminant as well. I buy tea bags from a CA tea company, the warning says the same thing.   The result: I just ignore warnings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTwo years ago Google planned to build about 4000 or 400 housing units and later the company gave up, why? Because the government fee per unit is about $240k, you can not build an affordable housing if one has to pay about $240k to the government alone per unit. Facebook decided to move into Mountain View, and the company had to agree that the company will not provide food to its employees, why? Because to stimulate local restaurants, but that is silly, because facebook will hire some people to work in their own buildings if it allow to open restaurants in its own building. I think governments are doing too much for no benefit, with obvious harms.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat government need is to make a level field for all its citizens, rather than choosing one side over the other unless one side does not practice morally. Free higher education, medicare for all, break up big banks, increase tax for the rich and business UBI, etc, I support them all, but for rent control, these things do not work. What government can do is to encourage developers to build more units, once you have supply match up with demand, the rent will go down by itself. But what SF do is at the one hand, discourage developer to build more units by enforcing ridiculous tight rules, at the other hand, force rent control.  But if you have 2 millions family  with one million units of housing,you have housing crisis regardless you control rents or not.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCalifornia is the 8th largest economical body in the world, and CA is the poorest in US if cost of living is adjusted. CA is also controlled by democratic parties. Obviously not all democratic policies are working.  CA spend huge amount of money on welfare and one thing I can say for sure is that it is heavily abused by so called low income families.  Many people hide or lie about their incomes. So a universal rule is much better than a special rule.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, I am a Bernie supporter because who he is and his policies are universal, but I think it harmful if government is over-regulating its businesses.","labels":"a"},{"text":"&gt; What if those prisoners have families to support with that UBI? \n\nAny family over the age of 18 will be getting UBI as well.\n\nAny family under would enter the foster care system or an orphanage, which is the case currently when there's no one over 18 to take care of a child when the guardian\/parent is incarcerated.\n\n&gt; What if they have a job that they lost going to prison, and can no longer make mortgage payments?\n\nThat happens currently when you go to prison.

Our plan for UBI uses mostly money already in the economy. In monetary economics, leading theory states that inflation is based on changes in the supply of money. The Freedom Dividend has minimal changes in the supply of money because it is funded by a Value-Added Tax.\n\nIt is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability \u2013 primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn\u2019t universal basic income, it\u2019s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors. \n\nBtw, Yang has an economics degree from Brown and has spoken with many economists.

Panic attacks, insomnia, suicidal ideation, body temperature control issues, increased sex drive \u2014 they are all withdrawal symptoms and they can all last for years.

And that is the ONLY outcome that matters \u2014 saving your life.\n\nPeople often die because they go a few weeks without using, believing that opioid withdrawal is like they portray it to be on TV \u2014 3-5 days and you\u2019re done. Then, 14 days later they have a clinical panic attack and end up using, but they use the amount they used before withdrawal and it\u2019s too much and they OD.

It\u2019s unsafe, unregulated supply that\u2019s killing people.  \n\nIt is past time to end the war on drugs. To start, Hydrocodone should be sold OTC so that people have at least have one safe option. The Tylenol in hydrocodone is literally more dangerous than the opioid in it.  \n\nAlso, every doctor should be able to prescribe as much methadone and Suboxone as they want, and rural areas especially need access. Testing kits should be sold at checkout counters and priced the same as a Snickers. So should Narcan. You don\u2019t technically need a prescription to get Narcan where I live, but pharmacists will lie and say you do or give you a huge hassle if you try to get it from them.  \n\nAlso, safe consumption sites needs to be everywhere. So many people die just because they were using alone.\n\nFrom there, in the U.S., we need UBI, guaranteed housing (even if you\u2019re using), and universal health care (including psychiatric help). \n\nAlso, we obviously need to completely stop sending people to jail or prison for drugs. My fianc\u00e9\u2019s friend died because he got pulled over for speeding and was worried about getting arrested for having drugs on him so he swallowed all the drugs he had.

How convenient that the Southern Strategy having a racism angle only comes out when it is impossible to contradict, with no one to corroborate it. Totally not suspicious. Richard Nixion, a man who suppourted the 1964 Civil Rights act, who's administration aggressively desegregated the public school system, who put into place the first affirmative action program in the country, who lost the deep south (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana) to George Wallace, decided to appeal to racists? Holy shit, if he did secure their vote he double-crossed them *immediately*.\n\nGeorge Wallance even specifically accused Nixion of wanting to desegregate the country. Like, that was  a thing he said about Nixion to try and stop people from voting for him. Had it not been for him splitting the racist vote between him and Herbert Humphry, Nixion probably would havd lost.There was only one Dixiecrat that joined the Republican party: Albert Watson. Every other southern Democrat stayed a Democrat. 3 or 4 other Democrats switched parties, but none of them were from the south. And the total number of defectors was like 5\/200.\n\nThen Nixon, (whose opponent championed what today would be called UBI, but yeah, the parties totally switched ideologies) proceeded to win the largest popular vote margin since WW2, because all of those racists apperantly didn't care that his pervious term was a giant fuck you to everything they believed. \n\nThen in 1974, Democrats sweep the South, again. Totally by coincidence I'm sure, his campaign made no mention of segregation right after the anti-segregationist Republican candidate trounced the pro-segregationist canidate two elections in a row. \n\nRemember how I said I learned about this while pursuing a history degree?

Automation will lead to the displacement of millions of workers. Without something to help catch them and allow them to find a new career path, they will simply fall through the system. Given that he makes this argument, especially in regards to truckers, why wouldn\u2019t he adopt a similar position on the healthcare industry? If you notice, he also isn\u2019t against automation; on the contrary, he actually believes it is a good thing. We need to help ease our people and economy into it though rather than just break into it. This is what I interpret as his meaning behind saying he supports \u201cthe spirit\u201d of M4A. I still wish he would just flat out support it, but given the context of his positions as a whole, it makes more sense. So, he isn\u2019t being complicit with the health industry, but rather wants to make sure he doesn\u2019t hurt the millions of people who work in it. \n\n&gt; to which every price in the economy would rapidly adjust, as is an inherent behavior of the markets\n\nSecond, this isn\u2019t supported by the data we have on UBI (and we have *decades* of it). UBI experiments have consistently shown that the effect UBI has on inflation of prices is either negligible or in fact slows it down. People receiving UBI are simply better off. \n\nA major reason for healthcare costs (including insurance premiums) going up was the existence of health insurance itself. Insurance companies wanted huge discounts, so the medical industry made their prices skyrocket so that they could give discounts on that price. If we fix the problem with costs, we also would lower insurance costs. Again, I think M4A is the best path forward, but Yang\u2019s plan would undeniably be a significant improvement still and it doesn\u2019t do anything to stop M4A from being implemented. In fact, with costs being lower, M4A would actually end up costing less to implement. \n\nSadly, M4A just isn\u2019t likely to pass, no matter who is president. Democrats have a majority in the House, yet the M4A bill in there has not even made it out of committee, and it has been there since last February. It has opposition not just among Republicans, but Democrats as well. We are going to need to primary out the vast majority of Democrats in Congress before we can implement M4A, and even then, we have to hope the ones who don\u2019t get primaried will jump on board with it rather than voting with Republicans on it. \n\n&gt; I truly feel like another moderate \n\nThird, this just isn\u2019t true because Yang isn\u2019t a moderate. He is a complex progressive, but a progressive nonetheless. In some ways, Bernie is more progressive (M4A, minimum wage), and in others, Yang is more progressive (UBI, ranked choice voting, Democracy Dollars), and on others topics they happen to be pretty even.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Yep, we already had Basic Income in the Blair years.

It rewards them by virtue of being American citizens, not for anything beyond that and the economic effects of inflation that would result from a FJG or UBI are underestimated, as is the fact that a UBI would make economic inequality significantly worse by virtue of the fact that the rate of return on investments is higher than growth.","labels":"a"},{"text":"That's why the important things are purchasing power and consumption, not actual prices, as I said in my first post earlier in the thread.

The billionaires and millionairs will not \"qualify\" for UBI.  This means there has to be a scale.  This scale has to be considered based on income being generated and not assets (*because basing it on assets opens another can of worms requiring another essay entirely*).  The very first thing having an actual scale will do is create a bigger divide.  But that's for later.  Right now, let's get to the \"meat\" of the problem and assume \"Universal\" really means \"all\" (even though it surely doesn't).\n\nHow to pay for it.\n\nIf everyone in the USA over the age of 18 qualified for UBI and received 35k per year that breaks down to monthly pay of $2,917 or weekly pay of $673. This would cost the taxpayers ***7.35 Trillion dollars.*** (210 million * 35k)\n\nIn 2014 the IRS collected $3.1 trillion in revenues.  This means that as of this moment, if there were NO other government spending at all, no programs, no military and no anything.. the US government can only afford to give everyone just under 15k per year. This is barely above minimum wage. The same minimum wage we all bitch about not being enough.\nBut that's not possible anyway, the government cannot simply dole out every penny collected to checks for everyone.\n\n***So all talk about 35k, 25k, 15k or any other number must stop immediately.  There simply isn't the revenue to support any kind of disruptive UBI.***\n\nAll of you positing numbers are pulling them out of thin air. We cannot currently pay for it, we cannot currently tax our way out of it. We could not even afford a couple thousand to everyone. Every thousand is 210 Billion.\n\nNow, some of us here are trying to be \"rational\" about it and the *\"but..but..buts\"* come out.. and saying things like *\"well if we do not have SS anymore, then that's a savings to help pay for it\"* What you are conveniently forgetting is that if we do not have social security program, no one will be paying SS taxes. So it is not a savings, it is a loss, a shift to tax burden.  \n\nOther \"rational\" arguments start with \"some people will still work, if a guy is making 50k, that little extra will be enough\".  To that I say, delusion is a weird thing.  The guy making 50k will have to make up for not only the loss in SS revenue but also to help fund UBI, his resulting paycheck will be debited by enough to where he is literally making pennies per hour over the base UBI amount he would be getting from not working.   No one can rationally or logically say that the guy working (any guy) will not be taxed. So you must consider this and not simply ignore it.\n\nIn my estimation, (*loss of IRS revenue to UBI receivers + cost of UBI = need to exponentially increase tax rates*) a person would need at the very least, 70k+ per year to even make a dent above UBI.  If you want to doubt me or call me out on this, feel free, just include some numbers and not hopes and wishes. But even then, you have to consider, \"is it worth it\"? If 70k gains some guy an effective 10k over the guy doing nothing, the 70k job becomes a 10k job.  It doesn't really matter what the final numbers end up, the fact of the matter is whatever UBI is for a non worker, will be calculated in the workers logical mindset. 70k is not 70k. Even if 70k is 50k after taxes (which let's be honest is not even close), he is still only \"making\" 10-15k at his job. Will some people work for that \"extra\" 15k.. YES.. will a significant number of people decide it's not worth it? YES again.  \n\nIn addition, with each person leaving their jobs the remaining work force will have more pressure, more to do and this robot controlled overworld we all think is coming that is not only not here yet, but also does not include the plumbers, the electricians, the health care workers and the 10,000 other jobs\/professions not do-able by any robot today and no robot in the foreseeable future.\n Right and wrong apply equally to hum\n\nIn short not only are you all seemingly living in the far future today (free robots everywhere! 3D printing!), but you do not bother with the pesky facts of money.\n\n\nNow remember my comment about \"Universal\", \"scale\" and \"divide\"? Let's look into that.  \n\nIf something isn't \"for all\" then it isn't \"Universal\" which means there will be a scale, a point at which you qualify for a \"basic income\".  This will be the \"safety net\" if you lose your job, but since it is \"basic\" income, it's not a net, it's a floor.  It's a floor to stand on.  While everyone here seems to think *the other guy* will enjoy working while you are off \"learning\" or \"having \"adventures\", \"living life\" and \"not stuck in a cubicle doing something you hate that slowly kills you\" there will be the average Joe who \"likes to work\".  Not you mind you, but \"Joe\", 'cause Joe's just that kind of guy.\n\nSee Joe works as a janitor, he makes 20 dollars an hour (the shortage of workers has raised minimum wage after all) and he likes to work, he doesn't care that John, Jeff and Mary are all sitting at home, while he is cleaning toilets.  He is making \"more\". He just likes to work. Joe doesn't mind working 40 hours a week to have 50 dollars a week more than you. He doesn't mind spending 20 on gas, maintaining his car, parking or any of the other assorted costs.  He doesn't mind that his daughter Sarah doesn't get to see him all day like John, Jeff and mary's kids. Joe doesn't get class envy, he thinks you're great and your choice not to work makes you awesome, not lazy (that's silly!) and he see's you are a fundamental cog in the societal machine (Fundamental! We Love UBI'ers!) He doesn't think you are a lazy sloth and you don't think he is a fool for working.  You get along GREAT!  When he pulls out his cash and you pull out your white government UBI card at Starbucks you say \"hello fellow contributing citizen, let's plan parties together!\"\n\nBut you know what's the real scary thing here?  \n\n*Joe doesn't exist.* \n\nHe is a figment of your imagination, just like mine here.  He's not real and there is no current robot other than a simple mop bot that can do Joe's job.  The mop bot cannot reach the toilet paper dispenser, reload the paper towels, understand that he needs to move the chair to get to the mess the day worker left. And if there were a real \"Joe\" he would hate you and eventually, you would hate him.\n\nYou must ask yourself, if UBI is good enough for some, why is it not good enough for all?  After all, that is the point, is it not?  To give enough for people to live on?  What makes you think it's enough for John, but not enough for Joe? What makes it good enough for \"you\" and not for \"me\"?  Go further down the rabbit hole as more and more generations emerge.  If your son saw you not working your entire life, where is his motivation? If Joes son see's his father working and not happy, but see's his friend Tim's father not working, what do you think Joe's son will do?\n\nMy son just got a job, it pays 9.50 an hour, why in the world would he decide to stock shelves when he could sit home and play xbox all day?\n\nObviously that's not \"all\" people and it's not \"all situations\" but my simplistic view is no different than someone saying \"The government can easily give us all 35k to live on, let the millionaires pay for it\"\n\n\nSome of you who bothered to read this ridiculous ranting wall of text will call me smug or think I know it all, but I ask you, did you put any real thought into UBI? Or is it just something you \"want\" to happen?  Because if you did not bother to do any research and you are going off how you \"feel\" then I daresay, you are the smug one, the know it all.\n\nJust be honest with yourself when you comment on UBI, be honest and look at the numbers first then think about potential consequences and other costs. \n\n\n","labels":"a"},{"text":"This is a common misconception of a universal basic income (UBI).

Dogma, not so much.\n\nYou're claiming it is irrational to believe that the people leeching off the system aren't going to start rioting\/protesting\/calling their legislators non-stop\/ETC. when the government says \"Hey, we're going to take away your food stamps, but don't worry, we'll give you this thing called UBI instead... you won't really get it if we explain it to you, so just trust us!\"...? Despite what you may think, **understanding that these people will do exactly that when told their food stamps are being taken away... and understanding that legislators will cave to their demands... is not irrational, it is realistic.**\n\n&gt;That's what I said, and that is my context. I had already stated \"drop out of the market\", and then you conveniently forgot it so that you could argue against verbiage rather than concepts.\n\nBoy you sure do love semantics don't you? Please explain to me in great detail: **What is the fucking difference between \"Not working and collecting a check\" and \"dropping out of the market\"?** Your own fucking quote has you saying they are the same thing, but apparently according to you I'm just \"too dumb\" to understand it.\n\n&gt;It's a good summary of the benefits of education, determined by market rates for skills at various levels. If you \"don't care\" about it, then you are just ignoring facts.\n\nAhhhh yes, \"ignoring facts\" that cite such \"unbiased\" and \"credible\" news sources as \"motherjones\". \n\n**If I want to \"not ignore facts\", I guess I should also take infographics from the national enquirer seriously too eh?**\n\n&gt;Well, I'm just going to quote the WSJ\n\nBecause citing an article that talks about **actually investing in infrastructure** totally has relevance to your topic, in which you suggest that investing in education is the equivalent of investing in infrastructure. **Makes sense.**\n\n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s all about jobs. When a company is going through a site-selection process, the more easily we can offer sites that have the required infrastructure in place, the better position we\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nOf course, you TOTALLY aren't taking a quote out of context. A quote where they are LITERALLY talking about INFRASTRUCTURE FOR CLEAN ENERGY being in place to entice companies to start business in that area and bring jobs. They TOTALLY mean what you claim they mean. (I'm TOTALLY not rolling my eyes dude, TOTALLY.)\n\n&gt;What if your required infrastructure is a strong applicant pool for engineering design work? \n\nThis is you attempting to rationalize your argument. Nobody will ever claim a \"strong applicant pool\" is the infrastructure for ANY JOB. **Would you call all the teenagers working at\/applying for a job at Mcdonalds their \"infrastructure\"? Fuck no you wouldn't, so why the fuck are you trying to rationalize the job of engineer in this manner?**\n\n&gt;The ROI is actually the profit divided by the assets. Over the life of a student, on whom you spent 100k, the student would earn around 2 million more than he would if he had only a high school degree. At a 20% tax rate, you would earn around 400,000 in increased tax revenue. That's an ROI of 4. But, for the person, the benefit is 5 times that. \n\nYour argument is based in the assumption that these people are going to find jobs in the field you paid to educate them in 100% of the time. We know that is patently false. Roughly 51% of 2014 employed college graduates work a job that DOES NOT REQUIRE A DEGREE. 31% DO NOT EVEN HAVE A JOB.

What the hell is \"investment of investment\"? You did some idiotic phrase substitution to end up with nonsense. The return, as above, is increased tax revenue and an increased, highly skilled employee base.\n\nYou are the one arguing that \"investing in college is essentially investing in infrastructure, therefore the return you will get from your investment will not be monetary, instead you get the \"investment\" in the \"possibility\" of tax revenue in the future\" ...

My idea fixes a coverage gap i see in andrew's plan in which some people would get unceremoniously dumped from UBI at 65 onto a social security plan that might not do them better, and i address this coverage gap by phasing UBI onto seniors and modifying social security in a way to ensure people are as well as\/better off than the status quo. \n\nI see why andrew doesnt touch social security after that although i hope he does address the potential coverage gap. \n\nBut then i see people defending welfare and im like dude you're defending people getting $500 a month with tons of restrictions...why?

The benefits are largely puny vs UBI.\n\nI just get frustrated at fellow lefties who i normally agree with acting in this way. I got on board with bernie in 2016  BECAUSE of my support for UBI. Even if bernie didnt support it, i knew he supported ideas that would get us moving toward guaranteed standards of living in our economy. He moved us in the right direction. And i wasnt about to eat our own just because the dude wasnt a UBI supporter. And ill still support bernie if yang drops or if i feel like i need to strategically vote to derail the concept of a biden presidency or something. \n\nBut yeah, people are just ridiculous and i find this so frustrating.

Given that resources are still limited (even if they're abundant), you need to restrict the amount of resources someone could use (even if the restriction is rediculously large due to the resource being abundant).\n\nThese are the economic conditions of the future we want to transition towards and UBI is a stepping stone towards that. As society becomes more and more automated, the UBI would increase to GDP - government spending. To pay for that UBI, an \"automation tax\" would be implemented and increase to 100% as society becomes more and more automated.\n\nIf you examine the current tax system, you'll find that most taxes are actually business taxes - either direct or indirect. Take income tax for example. An employee gets paid X wages, pays Y income tax, and takes home Z. It makes no difference to the employee if he gets paid Z directly and doesn't have to pay any income tax at all. This is because income tax is actually an indirect business tax on human productivity which businesses pay through increased wages. The employer would prefer to pay the increased wage rather than the tax because when they automate the job, they'll pay a lower rate of tax on capital.\n\nOther taxes are similar and at the end of the day, business productivity is what generates wealth and a portion of that wealth need to be taxed for government spending. The way the current tax system is set up though is inherently biased in favour of capital.\n\nAs society becomes more and more automated and the employment to population ratio continues to decline, the governments largest source of revenue - income tax - will also decline. What's needed is a single business tax on all productivity.\n\nProductivity is easy to measure and businesses already measure it. Given that you can assign monetary values to all input and outputs, productivity can be restated as the amount of money made from every \u00a31 spent. The greater the productivity, the more money you make from spending \u00a31. The more money you make from every \u00a31 spent, the higher the tax rate.\n\nAs stated earlier, taxes would need to increase as society automated to pay for an increasing UBI. The way to do that is by having a base tax rate which is linked to the employment to population ratio to provide a measure of how automated society is. The base rate could then be adjusted based on the productivity of the business. In a fully automated society with a 100% tax rate, owning is a business would no longer be profitable so it would make sense for the owners to sell the business to the state (which would also be automated) before that happened. In this way, the automated infrastructure becomes democratically owned and the wealth it generates is then distributed to the people via consumption tokens.\n\nCapitalsim will not be overthrown in a violent revolution but will transition gradually to communism as technology forces it to do so over the next few decades. This is the inevitable fate of capitalism in a democratic nation because as the employment to population ratio decreases, more and more people will become unemployable and demand UBI. With the increasing demand for UBI, there will be an increase in politicians offering to implement UBI. With more and more politicians offereing to implement UBI, more politicians will be elected to implement UBI. With the number of elected politicans in favour of UBI increasing, the balance of power will utimately change in favour of it.","labels":"s"},{"text":"I think no social nets being in place now is our biggest mistake.

If everyone pursues their own interests that seems nice in theory until you realize that self interests contradict with one another and sometimes people gain at the expense of other people.\n\nUtilitarianism, trying to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, essentially attempts to measure everyone's self interest and reach the most optimal conclusions for all parties involved. \n\nIt should be noted Im not a pure utilitarian, I actually do implement some elements of other ideas such as rights into my view, mainly because I beleive these have inherent utilitarian outcomes in some ways. It might make sense, from an act utilitarian standpoint, to kill one to please 10 others, but it might be better still to have a right to life, which overrides these individual cases and establishes extra parameters that help achieve even greater long term outcomes, because a society in which we dont send people to their deaths for the sake of others may be better than ones that we do all the time. If that makes sense. So Im not even a pure utilitarian even. Just primarily utilitarian that borrows from other views sometimes to improve the concept beyond its natural shortcomings.\n\n&gt;It just feels wrong to me to see other people suffer. I do not enjoy to live off of other people's misery. But I know these feelings are partly instinctual and that morality is a construct of society and perhaps evolution. Good and Evil do not exist in the universe, only in our minds.\n\nDo you enjoy suffering? No? Then try to avoid causing others to suffer. Pretty straightforward to me. There are preferences in humanity that are nearly universal, not suffering is one of them. So suffering should be minimized.\n\n&gt;Murder feels wrong to me. But I cannot logically tell you why it is wrong other than it is destructive to society.\n\nbecause humans have developed strong survival instincts and a preference for life. Morality and government are rules established to better improve our lives in line with our natural evolved proclivities. Murder is essentially counter to the purpose of morality and pretty much undermines the purpose of it in the first place. We could live in a world in which we kill each other, but most of us would not find that preferable. \n\nAlso, religious arguments arent that strong. Ever hear of the euthyphro dilemma? Is murder bad because god says so? or is it bad because of other reasons? What if god said murder was good? Would you be okay with killing others? I'd imagine you would still have problems with the concept. Which kind of defeats the purpose of god. Some dude saying \"because I said so\" isnt a good argument that appeals to more evolved moral psyches. Morality, in order to not be arbitrary, must be based on something based in the real world. Not mere \"authority.\" Which brings us back to your question. And I think I already posed an adequate answer.\n\n&gt; people have always had to work to survive.\n\nWhich is a bit of an argument from nature. We've spent most of our history dying from inadequate medical treatment too, due to medicine being a modern thing. Just because something is natural doesn't make it good or right. if anything, if you really take what I said above and its implications seriously....morality and governance is essentially unnatural. It's taking the state of nature and saying \"screw this, we can do better.\" So simply saying people have always had to work isn't a good argument for the virtues of work. \n\n&gt;Our existence on the planet coerces us to work for our own survival. \n\nYes, but capitalism kind of turns those urges against us in a systemic kind of way to avoid responsibility for its actions. Capitalism also establishes a system of property rights that are unjust to many from a certain perspective. And while im not totally against the concept of property like some on the far left, these shortcomings should be taken into account, and compensated for.\n\n&gt;While there may a come day when people no longer have to work, I think it's obvious that technology has not reached that point.\n\nWe are quickly reaching that point. A lot of my views on economics were also forged during the recession. During the obama years. I got rid of my immature right wing views, and between college education in the social sciences, and applying that stuff to my life and what we're doing as a whole....our system is messed up.\n\nWe predicate our society on the belief that everyone must work and earn their own right to exist more or less....but our system doesnt guarantee work. We have a system where many can be out of work...while the rich make record profits, and what do we do? Insist on \"job creation\" to create more work for people to do....we are literally trying to create work to satisfy a paradigm predicated on the idea that everyone must work. But work for everyone not only is irrational to me, it's a fool's errand. our society can't function without an excess labor force. We would get stagflation. And this excess labor force also leads to a lot of the exploitation under capitalism, because it drives down wages and worker's rights. Combine this with the rise of global capitalism in which elites can destroy jobs in places that demand high standards for them and create them in third world crapholes for pennies on the dollar and you got a system in which work simply cannot and will not guarantee everyone a decent existence.\n\nCombine this with automation. A lot of jobs will reach the point in coming decades where automation could destroy tons of jobs. We're working on self driving cars. That will put a lot of people out of work, truck drivers, for example. A lot of fast food work will be automated, possibly retail. There have been studies saying we could see like half our jobs disappear in 20 years before. \n\nhttp:\/\/nerdist.com\/report-finds-47-of-u-s-jobs-at-high-risk-of-being-automated-in-10-20-years\/\n\nAnd what's our answer? Oh, well we will create more jobs. We value work for its own sake, not because of it being necessary. And I dont believe we will ever be totally free of work. But I do think we could get rid of a lot of grunt work and involuntary work. We could make it more voluntary, having people on UBI get a minimum and people who wanna work make more. I think that's a fair compromise. people still have freedom to do what they want, they actually have more freedom due to not being coerced into crappy jobs.\n\nBasic income isnt fully automated luxury gay space communism. It's compatible with capitalism. It makes life easier, but also is compatible with a paradigm in which many people still choose to work. It simply offers a floor and is compatible with our current system today.\n\n&gt;Given that basic income, realistically, will not happen any time soon, do you have any ambition to work? \n\nPositive ambition? No. Does coercion work? Yes. But a life in which I have no positive ambition and I'm coerced is essentially the life of a slave. Which is why I have the views I do.\n\nShould be worth noting here I may also have aspergers, not diagnosed but highly suspected, and that may impact my motivation too. \n\n&gt;Would you work in a job if you thought you were fairly compensated for your labor?\n\nIf I believe the tradeoffs were worth it, sure. But I can't really see that happening without UBI. Because work without UBI is inherently coercive since I can't realistically say no...and the employer knows that. So I work on his terms, not my own. \n\nNow, if I could negotiate with a boss to set my hours up a certain way, and not have to work overtime, and have so many days off, and actually be able to exert my own bargaining position through refusal to work if he refuses my terms, that would make the concept much more palatable. But again, work as it exists is akin to slavery to me. Workers dont have that freedom, they dont have the autonomy. They listen to what the boss man says, or they screw off and starve. \n\n&gt;LIs there a certain job you could see yourself doing?\n\nWhen I was a christian, I wanted to do something in politics ironically, which is why I have such a passion for the subject. I beleived it was my \"calling\". Now, I realize jobs in politics are difficult to get, my views of right and wrong no longer fit in the mainstream, I have personality quirks that make me brutally honest and unwilling to compromise with what I see as a corrupt political establishment, and I don't believe I'm a good fit. So Im screwed.\n\nI think if I could do it all over without any of this religion BS clouding my mind I would've done something with computers. \n\n&gt;Or is it the nature of work that you oppose\n\nIm very much against the nature of work. But I recognize many people value the system as it is so basic income + capitalism is a good compromise I think. It gives everyone what they want IMO. Except maybe the elites who pay more taxes and have a work force that is less responsive to their every whims because they actually have a right to refuse them. ","labels":"s"},{"text":"Exactly.

Unemployment systems are so overwhelmed by 10+ million people applying for it all at once, and in a really stupid twist, some people are getting paid more by being laid off.

If we got rid of unemployment entirely, and just had UBI, unemployed would never pay more than having a job, and we would get rid of all the paper work.  Effectively all the paper work just gets moved to you tax returns, where you simply add a $12,000 to your W2.    \n\nUBI could also allow us to remove all sorts of government programs such as WIC, and housing programs, and all sorts of things.

Likewise, with UBI serving as a security blanket, more people would be willing to make investments, which could spur further economic growth.\n\nAs for how you teach people how to invest, look towards fantasy sports platforms.

To cover rising year costs of UBI it would have to be some where in the region of 45-50% minimum tax rate.  \n\nI live in the UK so I'll use our current figures. At the moment there are 45 million adults  over the age of 18 . \n\nSo cost of a UBI of \u00a310,000  is \u00a3450 billion per year . (thats \u00a3450,000,000,000)\n\nNow in the uk there are currently a population increase of 200,000 (deaths V births) so there is an increase in those who are now eligible to claim UBI  Leading to a \u00a320 billion increase year on year at current rates.\n\n\nWith current taxation rates the government is in a receipt of only \u00a3592bn a year  with a deficit of \u00a382 billion at least. \n\nYou can see there is very little room for movement in current finances . \n\nWhat about taxation . Well you have to try and get the countries finances in to a surplus so you can cover the extra expense that is incurred over a long period of time such as birth rates , natural inflation, currency value (the \u00a3 or $ may decrease in value in the markets due to the new fiscal policy, imagine your working temporarily with a visa even though your not a citizen and therefore you don't get UBI you will have to pay much higher rate of taxes from the first \u00a3 you earn).\n\nThis leads to the tax rates . currently if you earn less than \u00a310,000 you pay no tax .  if you are payed over \u00a310,000 you only pay tax on the money over that amount.  so an average income of \u00a330,000 you get a take home pay of \u00a323,000 after all the taxes .   Now lets look at the same situation with UBI .  you get \u00a310,000 tax free from the government.  then you have to pay a 50% tax to cover natural increases the following 5 years. so your down to \u00a315,000 minus another 17% for National insurance .  that brings it down to \u00a312,450 . So your yearly take home pay is \u00a322,450 after taxation  . \n\n\nWhat about low paid ?  Well minimum wage in the UK is \u00a36.90 per hour . so if you work 16 hours  a week you get \u00a35740 which is tax free plus a chunk of money of the government called working tax credit that brings your wages up to \u00a312,000 tax free.    so that's \u00a312,000 tax free that costs the tax payer only half the amount and decreases as your wages increase . \n\nNow what would he get under UBI \u00a310,000  plus   \u00a32,870 after income tax or \u00a32,382 after national insurance making his yearly take home pay \u00a312,382.  wow an increase of \u00a3382 .  \n\nSO this looks better for the lower wages right ?    well yes and no .  while at first it may look good  workers soon realise that if they don't do the horrid low wage service job then they still get \u00a310,000 and instead do black market jobs , ones they don't have to claim tax on as it's all cash in hand .  That causes two issues . \n\n1) decreased workforce in the service sector , what is the only way to incentivise new workers to join ? wages big fat wage increases .  These increases would be so high it would drastically effect profits so hard prices would have to increase .  We are not just talking about the guy flipping the burger but also the farm hands (why work 30-40 hours a week to see half your money go ?) , warehouse workers , delivery men  and food production lines. a 2 \u00a3 increase in a workforce of just 10,000 leads to a huge increase in expenditure. but wages would have to almost double to  cater for the taxation.  Add onto that the increase in corporate taxation or even just the closing of current loopholes and you get entire companies going off shore  to reduce expense . \n\n2) less taxable income . As more low paid workers  move out of employment into the black market workforce less tax is being gathered by the government .  therefore spending is increased on enforcement of tax income , while the tax rate is increased once more to help reduce the deficit between government income and expenditure. The increase of corporation tax pushes the companies to move off shore to reduce it's taxation on profits , yet again reducing government  income from taxation.  \n\n\nBoth of these things will also push up prices of goods both made in the country and from outside. the value of the pound will decrease as economies around the world see how companies are pulling out of the UK . So things get more and more expensive to import , both final goods and materials for manufacturing. \n\n\nUBI can cause more problems than it could ever solve in the long term .  While it helps artists , performers , students . To the average worker it is of very little benefit. It only serves to increase prices over the long term to above natural inflation and a huge growth in governments deficit . \n\nA better and cheaper system is to increase tax thresholds . So you only pay tax on wages above a given value. this system keeps inflation lower and  a more even handed tax rate. It also makes sure that money is going where it is needed . It can also be used in conjunction with a means tested (connected to your tax return) working tax credit (like it is now)  to bring your wages up to a certain level without incurring tax . \n\n\n\nThere is also the skills loss.  If your in a high paying IT job earning say 100,000 a year in current taxes you will get \u00a364,967 take home after tax and nation insurance (NI pays for NHS and social supports) . where as under UBI you get \u00a341,500 a year take home pay after tax and NI  so add that to your UBI that's a drop of 13,000 a year in your take home pay .  Now you get an offer from a company in say France where the tax rate is similar to the UK as it is now . Why wouldn't you not move you get an increase in take home pay  and better weather.   \n\nSo you start to see a skills gap creeping into the job market . How do you plug that gap? increase wages cos no one from outside the UK is going to want to pay 50% tax off the bat while working 35-45 hours a week for only 43K a year .  \n","labels":"a"},{"text":"I don't think you understand social security in the US.

A quick search proves almost the opposite. Many studies have been done on this subject albeit small ones, but they almost all show the same thing. \n\nI actually didn't say that specifically, but yes, I do believe this would incentivize a small portion of the population away from work. That said, my single largest issue with UBI is that it's simply a mechanism to redistribute wealth. Now, if that's your end-game, then so be it. I take no issue with helping those in need, though I don't think the government has a particularly great track record on that front either... But, UBI isn't simply a program for helping those in need, or even one based on merit. The government isn't our savior, so why would I give it more money in taxes just so that it can hand me back \"my fair share\" in the form of UBI. If anything, I'd much rather direct it at those that are most deserving of assistance.  \n\n\nIf UBI is such an easy sell, why hasn't California or New York or Vermont instituted their own state level UBI? Seems like it would be easy enough. Why wait for the federal government when you could effectively solve homelessness in California? See, while I think UBI is a horrible idea, I'm also a federalist. Let a couple of states put UBI to the test and see what happens. If what VOX is saying is accurate, it should be a smooth process with easily verifiable outcomes. In that case, you'd likely see more wide spread adoption at a scale that is (slightly) more capable of managing the process.  \n\n\n&gt;I really dont know how america lost it's way so hard. We literally have a massive portion of our population that, quite literally, wants people to die of entirely preventable causes in the \"richest country in the world\". \n\nSure feels like you're accusing me of wishing death on my fellow man. It's entirely unwarranted, and I don't appreciate it. Further, there is no evidence that this is representative of any \"massive portion\" of our population.   \n\n\n&gt;Would some choose that life? Probably, but those are the people we want out of workplaces anyways. They are toxic, lazy, and force others to be more productive. \n\nAnd the answer to bad behavior is... let them be a burden on our tax system? Nah, I don't believe in incentivizing bad behavior, especially not with my taxes. Chances are decent that if someone is actually toxic or lazy, they'll be out of a job sooner or later anyways. Employers don't take nicely to people that lose them money or harm productivity. Nothing like the prospect of being without income to correct bad behavior, right?  \n\n\n&gt; Plus \"free money\" gives them a place to BE. Imagine being able to enforce homelessness laws, or vagrancy laws, because we know someone has a place to stay? \n\nI'll admit. This is a tough subject in general, and I don't have an easy answer to it. The problem is that a significant number of those who are homeless are either suffering from chronic mental illness or made poor choices that lead them to that situation. NOT ALL, but a lot. While giving those people money *may* help some, it doesn't solve the underlying issues that lead to them being homeless, and doesn't assure they won't be homeless again. Thus, treating UBI as the solution is misguided in my opinion. This is probably one of the few places I actually support more government assistance, but in the form of mental health services.","labels":"a"},{"text":"This is why I struggle to put my own political beliefs into a proper term.

It's just a class system locking itself in. I agree that this is unconscionable and the state should fund all schools. \n&gt; This helped me gain perspective on student-teacher ratios; on paper, the difference between my hometown, Canton's ratio of 12:1 to the King school's ratio of 14:1 seems pretty negligible\n\nIs this really the thing though?

I'm a big fan of Andrew Yang for the UBI idea. Technology is wildly splitting productivity among the population with devastating results. Some people just aren't worth that much, because they could be replaced with automation reasonably easily (which means that their MAXIMUM worth is automation cost - $1). Then those people have to work two jobs, not have enough time for their kids, which congregate in areas because the housing can't be too expensive, resulting in bad schools etc etc. It's a very vicious circle, and numbers don't support even the best teachers on the planet solving it.\n\nGiving the parents a breather with $1k\/month even if they are working would be VERY helpful, and hopefully allow them to survive with a single job and spend more time with their kids, attend PTOs and do all the other things that actually make schools great.\n\n\nNote that nothing you suggest would really solve this. The poor would still end up in the same neighborhoods (because their very presence in high concentration will drop prices, which pulls in more etc), have less time for their kids, have more distractions in the school, resulting in most teachers not wanting to teach there, resulting in people who can't get easily into top careers etc without exceptional abilities or will.\n\n&gt; They weren't born with the white shield I was\n\nI think you're making this racial where it's far deeper in than that, and it is racial only accidentally due to the historical underprivileged of certain groups.\n\nWe need to attack the whole income inequality problem to tackle the larger problem, and I don't think that'll be possible without UBI or damaging the economy (which I'd rather not do).","labels":"s"},{"text":"UBIs are available and redistributable freely from their public registry.

Example #1: And I would pardon everyone who's in jail for a  non-violent drug related offense. Example #2: Q: So only marijuana, not  all non-violent drug offenders. YANG: Yes, that's correct. Example #3:  Decriminalize small quantities of opioid use and possession. (Bold  emphasis mine to illustrate contradictions)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;How are these contradictionary statements?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Pardon  is for all non-violent marijuana drug offenders, with maybe additional  room for other drugs but starting with marijuna. Pardons are only for  people already convicted.\n\nThe contradiction is simple. Yang said, \"And I would pardon everyone who's in jail for a  non-violent drug related offense.\".  He didn't say possession only (he used the term \"related\")...and he didn't say only for marijuana...but for \"drug related offenses\".  Then he says it is just for a small amount of possession and only for marijuana and opioids.  \n\n&gt;Nuclear  works perfectly well with renewables because nuclear gives you the   baseline you need and then renewable+battery takes care of the rest.\n\nThat baseline is an issue though.  Demand for electricity through a day can vary dramatically.  At the same time supply from wind\/solar can also vary greatly.  Nuclear can't ramp up and down capacity quickly to match...which means it is a poor compliment for renewables.  This is why California which has a large number of wind\/solar farms is using natural gas to compliment renewables...as that IS flexible.\n\n&gt;Website  regulations: EU already has the GDPR guidelines that force companies to  set up their data in such a way that it is easy to delete and e.g.  tables have fields specifying which rows (cause they are tied to person  x) can be used for models or not.\n\nIn real life I'm an IT worker.  I can assure this isn't easy.  the GDPR guidelines were very controversial.  Most of what websites do now to \"comply\" is to show a simple popup asking users to agree to their guidelines before entering.  I'm not aware of many if any websites that offer the level of user control that Yang is requesting.\n\nYes tables have rows and fields...but often tables point to other relational tables.

But okay its a comparison  between tulci and yang.\n\nI'm actually concerned about smartphones too.  But I don't think a government agency with its associated cost and bureaucracy is the right answer.  Such an agency could make developing smartphone apps a nightmare.\n\n&gt;Automation  In pretty much any interview he mentions automation is the cause of  many problems but we should not try to stop it, yet bring  government\/society up to speed with automation. What you describe is  completely the opposite of his position. He even warns that there will  be groups of people (e.g. truck drivers) actively protesting automation  unless we take measures now and support there lives and the transition  better. Nowhere does he mention stopping automation.\n\nTruck drivers will likely never be automated in our life time.  Self driving cars are technically too difficult now.  They struggle with unexpected situations and they don't understand intent. \n\n&gt;VAT  value added tax is a tax on the added value. So if i buy something for  $95 and sell it for $100 I pay the 10% tax on the $5 difference. So the  current company pays $0.50. Now if the raw materials at beginning of  supply chain are $10 and you have many companies adding value and   buying\/selling, once you got to $100 \"value\" then total tax paid by all  companies in supply chain is 10% \\* $90 is $9.\n\nTypical VAT is applied to the sale price...expenses are not deductable.  Yes, a retailer can get a credit but this is based on the previous VAT paid by upstream suppliers...and not the markup.

You can't look at only taxes and conclude whether they are  progressive\/regressive, you always need to consider transfers as well.\n\nOnly for the very poor would enjoy net positive \"progressive-ness\".

Another possibility is *R* = 0.37 (the same top tax rate we have now) and *C* = 4,440, which preserves the current \"zero tax bracket\" of 12,000.\n\nMy ideal tax system would feature a flat tax rate of approximately 28 percent with a universal credit of 8,230 per person.  No other credits or deductions.  The credit is refundable (partially -- see below), so it operates like a basic income.  This hugely simplifies the tax return so that almost everybody can do a return and understand what they're doing.  Although it's linear, it's still progressive because higher incomes pay a higher percentage of income.\n\nFor example, someone making 60,000 has a tax bill of (60,000 x .28) - 8,230 = 8,570, an effective tax rate of 14.3%.  Someone making 100,000 has a tax bill of 19,770 (eff. rate 19.8%).  Someone with $15,000 income has a \"negative tax\" of 4,030 (i.e. they get their withholding back and 4,030 extra.)  Anyone with income under 29,393 would have zero or negative tax.\n\nUnder the current (2017) system, the $60,000 earner pays 8,145, the $100,000 earner pays 18,145, and the $15,000 earner pays 463.  The results around the middle-class are about the same.  The proposed system is slightly more progressive than the current system, even though it only has one tax rate\n\nMany people don't know that under the current system, a dependent with income has to file their own return.  Some of these people include their dependents' income on their own tax return.  What if instead of a misconception, this was actually a feature of the system?\n\nThere would be no filing statuses, dependents, etc.  Just list who you want on the return, report all income and take all of the credit (8,230 times the number of people on the return).  Everyone listed on the return must sign (or their parent\/guardian in the case of minors).  Because of the linearity of the tax formula, the result comes out the same whether you file a joint return or multiple separate returns.  If the three above are a married couple with a 20-year old child, they could file together.  Total income = $175,000.  Tax = (175,000 x .28) - (3 x 8,230) = **24,310** = 8,570 + 19,770 - 4,030.  No need to remember the complexities of who is or is not a dependent.  No more arguing about or running hypotheticals about who claims each child, since the results will be the same (one net) regardless of how you handle the return.  Head of household, the most confusing and abused filing status, is abolished.  \n\nSocial security income is considered 50% taxable, 50% exempt.  This reflects the fact that half of Social Security contributions are made by the employer, and are not taxed.  This puts the employee share on par with a Roth IRA, where the earnings are never taxed (as long as the taxpayer waits long enough to withdraw the funds).\n\nThere are a few wrinkles I might consider useful:\n\n1. Because of the success of the EITC and ACTC in encouraging work, maybe the universal credit should only be refundable up to some percentage of earned income.  I would guess at 60%, the current phase-in rate of EITC for 3+ children plus then phase-in rate for ACTC.\n3. Any \"negative tax\" would not be refunded all at once, but in monthly installments from May to the following April.  You would still get your withholding back right away.\n4. Self-employed people with gross revenues under 192,600 would get \"standard expenses\" of 1\/3 of their gross revenues.  This almost perfectly offsets the self-employment tax.  (10,000 gross revenues - 3,333 standard expenses = 6,667 profit.  SE Tax = 6,667 x .9235 x .153 = 942.  Income tax = 6,667 * .28 = 1,867.  Total = 2,809.)  I chose 192,6000 because the profit of 128,400 is approximately equal to the 2018 Social Security wage base.\n2. Depreciation would be all-or-nothing.  You buy some equipment for your business and sell it later.  If you deducted the cost, all of your proceeds is taxable income.  If you didn't deduct the cost, you have a gain or loss according to the usual rules.  Small businessmen using \"standard expenses\" would not report the sale at all, except at a gain.\n\nThe 28% tax rate should be adjusted to make the proposal revenue-neutral.  The 8,230 credit is halfway between the poverty line for a single person and the \"additional amount per family member\" for the poverty line.  It's slightly too low for a single person, just right for a family of two, and slightly too high for families of 3 or more.\n\nExamples:\n\n* A single mother with 2 children earns $20,000.  She files a return with herself and both children.  Tax = 20,000 * .33 = 5,600.  Credit = 8,230 * 3 = 24,690.  Net tax = -19,090.  But the \"negative tax\" is limited to 60% of her earned income, so she gets 12,000 instead.  She gets a monthly check of 1,000.  Her family is lifted above the poverty line but she still has a strong incentive to find a better-paying job.  (2017 system:  She files HoH with 2 dependents.  Her standard deduction + exemptions is 21,500.  Tax = 0.  Credits = 2,000 (ACTC) + 5,261 (EITC) = 7,261.  Net tax = -7,261.  She gets a lump-sum payment of 7,261.\n\n* A family of three (two adults, one 16 year old child and one 19 year old child in college) earns $75,000.  Tax = 21,000.  Credit = 8,230 * 4 = 32,920.  Net tax = -11,920.  They get a monthly check for 993.33.  (2017 system:  They file as MFJ.  They have itemized deductions of $16,000.  They have 16,200 in exemptions.  They are taxed on 42,800, making their tax 5,491, which is offset by 1,000 in child tax credit and 2,500 American Opportunity Credit.  They pay 1,991.  2018 system:  Their itemized deductions don't matter.  They are taxed on 51,000, making their tax 4,025, which is offset by 2,000 child tax credit and 2,500 American Opportunity Credit.  They have a \"negative tax\" of 475.)\n\n* A married person with two children makes 250,000.  His spouse does not work.  Tax = 70,000.  Credit = 4 * 8,230 = 32,920.  Net tax = 37,080.  (2017 system:  They have itemized deductions of 50,000.  Their exemptions are phased out.  They are taxed on 200,000 and their tax is 42,885.  Child tax credit is phased out.  2018 system:  The state tax deduction is limited, so their itemized deductions are 42,000.  They are taxed on 208,000.  Their tax is 38,499 but they qualify for 4,000 child tax credit so they only pay 34,499.)\n\nYou can see that this tax system is comparable to the current tax system, but by doing away with dozens (hundreds?) of targeted deductions and credits makes the tax code simpler and more understandable to all.  Many working poor and the people they support will be lifted out of poverty without destroying the incentive to work.","labels":"s"},{"text":"If you don't see how selling UBI for everyone makes it easier to achieve, then I don't know what you tell you.

However that's one of those points where a traditional notion of labor and capital will break down because traditionally businesses want their customers rich and their workers poor, it's only now that companies like Wal-Mart are beginning to realize their workers are their customers. So in other words- fuck me if I know we're dealing with an entirely new paradigm.

We need to start working on our redistribution schemes, a new social contract were we take indeed more from the rich and give to the pour, while everyone conforming, basically enhancing today's welfare programs.

If I can't get those ten people together, I'm not going to try - I'll just throw my back out. That doesn't mean I don't actually want to build the house. Another analogy is war - I may think its a great idea to invade Norway and take their oil. But doing so requires enough people to agree with me such that I can form an army and actually win. Me running through Oslo with a gun by myself simply won't get the job done, and my failure to take that action doesn't mean my belief is insincere.\n\nThis is the problem with almost all the \"if you like this policy so much why don't you go do it yourself\" - it's a really facile way of thinking about policy.\n\n2) Many arguments for higher taxes and UBI are basic moral arguments, and therefore people, very reasonably, believe they should apply to everyone equally.

For rich people, this is not 'wasting money on other people,' this is investing in society and making the world a better place for all to live. For poor people, this isn't 'living off the state', it's providing the basic necessities to continue to function in society. Without welfare\/healthcare\/other government programs, life is just a slow, painful path toward death. And, spending to help the poor has clear economic benefits as well. For everyone to contribute in society and the economy, they have to have a stable source of income and a modest amount of cash to spend on goods and services. If we shut poor people out of the economy entirely (refuse to train them, refuse to support them until they rejoin the workforce), we lose human potential to other, wasteful programs. In any government budget supported by the people, the people's basic life and dignity should be the number one priority, regardless of the cost. This is why the 'universal basic income' is necessary, in a world where people will be unable to work for food, the government must step in or people will die. \n\nThe current narrative from the people in power (republicans) is: Heavy government spending into programs that benefit poor people is basically a waste of money. If poor people haven't had the ability in the past few decades to build wealth 'on their own', what is a few hundred dollars going to do to help them? That money is better spent on government programs with proven results, like strengthening military and keeping the economy stable for the people with the real power. As a rich businessman, if I was given a check from the government, I could easily double or triple that money in a few months through investment and interest. Food stamps just leak that money out slowly, without doing anything to help recipients participate in the economy (if their food and shelter is paid for, why would they work\/do anything? They can just sit in their public housing eating public food, watching public TV without a care in the world). If rich people have to start spending to support poor people, investment falls flat, everyone making less than 6 figures voluntarily chooses to be unemployed, and the global economy grinds to a halt. The only way to improve standards of living for poor people is to keep advancing technologically and economically and convince poor people to buy into this system (make money, spend money, make more money). Anyone that dies in this capitalist system was working against it, not putting their labor to maximum economic value. \n\nI think this quote sums up the current Republican view best:\n\n&gt; We can't spend money on programs just because they sound good. And Meals on Wheels sounds great -- again, that's a state decision to fund that particular portion to.  But to take the federal money and give it to the states and say, look, we want to give you money for programs that don't work -- I can't defend that anymore.  We cannot defend that anymore.  We're $20 trillion in debt. We're going to spend money, we're going to spend a lot of money, but we're not going to spend it on programs that cannot show that they actually deliver the promises that we've made to people. - Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget, March 16, 2017\n\nThe biggest issue here is that both systems are necessary. A world without the government spending on the people is a world without roads, police, water, electricity. Government spending is clearly useful, at some level. Then again, a world without the stock market, big banks, oil, and military is a world stuck in the 1800s. The only reason the world can sustain this many people today is because of the advances we've made in transportation, communication, and manufacturing technology, and most of that comes from huge concentrations of financial and social wealth. To say that government should subsidize everything at the cost of the rich and powerful is to sacrifice exactly what is keeping society as a whole going (creating new jobs, paying for existing ones). \n\nSo, we need a stable balance between 'government paying for everything' and 'screw the poor'. It's clear that government has to pay for public projects (roads, water, electricity, police). Why not food then? Why not healthcare? Why not basic housing? These are equally valuable, the only difference is that they are used more by poor people than rich people. They're also super expensive to implement effectively. After all, rich people do have a lot of different things to spend money on, and paying taxes isn't on the top of their list. We have to convince politicians that food, healthcare, housing spending plans:\n\n1. Actually work, aren't just half-measures that look good\/sound good but ultimately don't contribute to economic growth\/stability\n2.

You can see socialist policies as \\*means\\* through which we bring about communism as an \\*end\\*. As support for this, I will point out that no major country has ever declared itself to have achieved \"communism.\" They had communist parties, but not a communist society (just like how we have a democratic party and a green party in the US, but that doesn't automatically mean we are totally democratic or totally green). The closest anyone taken seriously came to saying they had achieved communism was when Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union \\*was going to\\* achieve it in the following 30 years. Khrushchev had a reputation for being hyperbolic. Communism is usually described as a society where social relations of production and technology have either become so efficient or automated that most human needs (not wants) can be accounted for with a minimum of coercion. In its ideal scenario, a formal state apparatus ceases to be necessary in order to force people to work or behave because they have less to fight for.\n\nIf this sounds like a \"pie-in-the-sky\" dream, that's because it is. Most socialists would agree that it is. That's why Marx generally thought it was an uninteresting topic. \"Communism\" under this definition functions more as a guiding light, almost like the North Star. We may not ever be able to go there, but it can help us orient ourselves and get us moving in the right direction. Socialist policies, in this analysis, are more pragmatic; they are more concerned with what we can do now than with what we'd like to do in some ideal scenario. Sure, lots of socialists use utopian language, but it tends to be more for motivational purposes, to get us thinking about what kinds of things we'd like to change once we start thinking about the present world again.\n\nI personally do not care for this distinction between socialism and communism as much though. But I'd have to start bringing in my own analytic categories to explain exactly what I mean. Suffice it to say, socialism is more concerned with distribution in my opinion, while communism is more concerned with production. Because of this, socialism trends towards centralization in a way that communism wouldn't necessarily do so.\n\nSo when you say that you can't imagine a socialist society doing any differently, I will concede that merely nationalizing all firms will not save the economy. Consumption of resources and production of waste is what needs to decrease. What we need is a sustainable economy. No profit-driven economy is sustainable since it will always need to grow. However, if production in the marketplace was not a means for ever-expanding profit, if it instead was tailored to human needs (either through democratized production or socialized distribution) then you are going to remove the incentive to overconsume resources and overproduce waste purely in the service of profit. We produce many products we don't need, and we waste a lot because convenience is more profitable than frugality (fast food is an example of this, where they will cook a lot of food that they know they will waste in some percentage because the profit they get from always having food available for convenience outweighs the cost of waste). And frankly, in a society that has better (fewer) hours for a living wage (due to automation, UBI, or efficient work arrangements), we'd probably all be a lot more patient and would have less of a need for convenient, fast food.\n\nBut alas, you are probably thinking of our two main examples of Socialist societies, the USSR and the People's Republic of China. Well, it is important to remember that these were both agrarian economies when their revolutions occurred. Marx's analysis is basically that capitalism and industrialization had ended scarcity. We now knew how to produce more than we needed (so much that we occasionally had economic collapses from overproduction). But capitalism had failed to end poverty, despite ending scarcity. He hoped for revolutions in fully industrialized countries, where the means to overcome scarcity were already in place and thus a society was possible that demands less work. However, communist parties have only had successful revolutions in agrarian countries where industrialization had not yet run its course. If you wonder about the industrialization or collectivization in the Soviet Union or Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, you are essentially looking at efforts to compress a century or two of industrialization into a decade or two. Frankly, industrialization is not a pretty process (just pick up a Charles Dickins novel to see). And trying to speed an already destructive and difficult process up caused a lot of damage. Now, they felt the need to catch up to their capitalist neighbors who had attempted (or succeeded) to invade their country and overthrow the new government. In that situation, I think anyone would feel impatient with slower forms of industrialization. Anyway, so when people outside the socialist tradition think of examples of \u201csocialism\u201d they either think of these two examples, which were each more or less as bad for the environment as industrialization was anywhere else or they instead (incorrectly) look at Modern China\u2026 which is probably better described as a bureaucratic capitalist system, where CEO\u2019s are appointed by the party bureaucracy.\n\nThese are certainly not very good examples of \u201csocialism in action.\u201d And even if you look at societies with many more socialist institutions than we have, I can\u2019t think of any good examples of societies which are primarily socialist rather than primarily capitalist with socialist institutions on top. I will confess near complete lack of knowledge about modern Latin American politics though, so one of the nominally socialist countries to our south could be illustrative. I have no clue.\n\nI still want to come back to my prior point though, the profit\/growth incentives in a capitalist society are ecologically unsustainable and untenable. These two motives do not necessarily exist in a socialist society, and so removing our incentives to consume resources and produce waste beyond what is necessary to account for our actual needs is an extremely important step. Moving to more efficient or abundant forms of energy (solar, geothermal, tidal, wind, hydro, etc. Hell, even some forms of Nuclear are clearly better in the short term than fossil fuels) is extremely important, but I suspect will be harder within a capitalist framework, since it relies on economically divergent interests to all collaborate against their own short-term, self-interest. After that, changes to consumption could probably take place over a longer period of time. I\u2019m convinced that many of our bad habits really come down to how little free time we are given away from our jobs, and how many corners we will cut in order to salvage as much of what is left as possible (for example, bad driving, not recycling, eating fast food, eating a familiar and therefore stereotyped and less diverse diet since learning new foods takes time and energy). Maybe if our economic system was not built on pitting us against each other in a competitive structure, we\u2019d be more habitually inclined to help each other out, to share. And maybe in a society with less symbolic value given to wealth, we\u2019d all do a lot less conspicuous or self-gratifying forms of consumption. For all these reasons, I would bet a socialist society to be better for the environment than a capitalist one.\n\n**&lt;Excursis&gt;** I hope that in my attempted care in responding to your first answer that I have laid enough groundwork that I needn't go into as much detail on each other question. I am happy to develop any of what I've said further, provided I feel like you are operating in good faith (as it seemed to me that you were earlier in this thread). But I hope that the structure of my first response will help acquaint you with how many of us here reason and the general structure of centrist views that we don't like.

When land values are common property, everyone benefits from them equally (either in the form of a citizen's dividend or essential public spending). But this does not affect an individual's right to use and manage the land as they see fit within the law.\n\n&gt;Or do private individuals own the land and pay a tax to the state?\n\nEveryone who now owns land can continue to \"occupy\" (viz. conditional ownership without the right to the location value) their land so long as they pay the annual location fee.\n\nThe location fee is adjusted each year as land values in the community increase or decrease.\n\nIf someone cannot meet the location fee, they lose the privilege to occupy the land (or in some situations the tax burden can be deferred until death and taken out of their estate). This ensures the land transfers to the person who will put it to its best use. It is in the community's interests for land to be in its best use as each person shares equally in the value of its increase through the dividend or increased public services. Ultimately, no one has a natural right to exclude others from a physical space without paying the opportunity cost to society when land is scarce.\n\nThe land's value is commonly owned by the community but the individual occupier owns the improvements (like buildings) they create. This is the fundamental distinction in Georgism between earned (wages and interest) and unearned wealth (land values), and the philosophical basis for taxing the unearned location value accruing to landowners.\n\n&gt;If there was a LVT of 10%, what would that mean to the average person?\n\nThe annual location fee is determined discounting the land value exclusive of improvements by the prevailing return to capital (usually around six per cent, but maybe not right now). (E.g. Land with value of $100,000 would pay $100k x .06 = $6,000 year in land value tax.)\n\nThis is under a 100% LVT. In George's single tax system a 100% LVT is the only tax funding government. No sales tax, income tax, payroll tax, capital gains, estate, property, inheritance or any duties or tariffs of any kind. (Yes, there is really is that much land value. No, we do not need to reduce current levels of public spending; if anything, it will be easier to increase them if the land value from public projects is recaptured).\n\n&gt;How high would a LVT tax need to be to fund a welfare state, etc?\n\nThe idea is to eliminate the need for a welfare state by eliminating the systematic causes of poverty\u2014one of the differences between geoism and socialism. If people are not getting robbed of their wages and interest by rent-seeking landowners, they will see the full fruits of their labors and find it much easier to lift themselves out of poverty. Over time this will reduce the need for a safety net. In the long run most public spending could be replaced with a UBI funded by LVT to provide a high level of material wealth to everyone.\n\nOtherwise a 100% tax is probably necessary to fund a welfare state if you are not using other taxes.","labels":"s"},{"text":"Minimum wage is necessary to a UBI.

Remember UBI savings are supposed to come from the distribution of money without questions and conditions. Your solution already is implementing questions and conditions. How would you determine that 123 apt # A is not a unique household and separate entity of 123 apt # B?\n\nThe opt-in option is none option from the start due to the fact that people who have the money don't benefit from the UBI since the intent of UBI is to spread their wealth. Your calculation of 60 - 70% tax would not cover the cost of funding since the funding would have to 3 times current tax revenue. People who are at 52% today would have to be at 100%. HST would need to be 36%\n\nMost people are confusing GDP with tax revenue. It doesn't matter how the money is spent. It matters how the taxes are collected to pay for it. You are taking money from one pocket and moving it to another. There is an assumption that there will be no loss of productivity, motivation and 100% participation. Most citizens would have to have a considerable tax grab which would push most into poverty.\n\nCombing through the numbers shows that there is not enough tax revenue. People are confusing GDP distribution with tax distribution. There is a simpler fix. We need to consider that there are effects from globalization  which favor the concentration of money and wealth to a few individuals. Imports from environmentally unfriendly countries. Imports from countries where labour is paid at slave wages. TFW. Investment rules which permit countries to invest here but which don't allow us to invest freely there. Copyright laws that encourage the accumulation of wealth instead of compensating the authors and creators. Corporate welfare for companies raking in record profits.\n\nOur fellow man doesn't have the decency that you talk about. The problems we are facing are being caused by our laws that don't treat people equally. Just look at the tech sector and how it is permitted to retain ownership of the products it sells. The concentration of wealth is a product of our laws which concentrate wealth. This whole discussion about UBI is generated so we don't ask why are we allowing our laws to concentrate wealth to the few. I'll give you a perfect example. The federal tax on carbon. It penalizes local small producers in favour of large multinationals. It encourages pollution. One of the biggest polluting industries on our planet is the freighter ships shipping industry.

You can imagine this already in something like a car factory - try to go and run a welder on a production line and see how they like it!\n\nThe other practical aspect of the U in UBI is that it eliminates means testing, which would yield huge efficiencies and savings. As soon as you say 'you need to work if you're able', you require vast ranks of public servants to design the tests and administer them, log everyone's various efforts, investigate cheaters, handle exceptions,  arbitrate disputes etc. etc. Think of the number of people you could just give the stipend to if you didn't have to deal with that!\n\nLastly:\n\n&gt; I disagree, I think we can manage both goals.\n\nI don't see requiring people to be productive according to some predefined metric as a 'goal'.

I know nobody wants to share a living space, but why do we hold this double standard that it's fine for students to live like that (the amount of student housing outnumbers apartments in my area 10:1, and it's all shared living spaces), but for basic income it \"obviously isn't enough\"?\n\nMaybe for some cities it really isn't enough, but then shouldn't basic income be tied to cost of living for a particular area then?

How Accessibility To Lunch Impacts Student Learning](https:\/\/soeonline.american.edu\/blog\/what-is-lunch-shaming)\n\nWhat Is Lunch Shaming? How Accessibility to Lunch Impacts Student Learning\n\nTuesday, June 30, 2020\n\n\ufffc\n\nWhat is lunch shaming? Imagine a high school cafeteria in which a student\u2019s meal is taken away and thrown in the trash in front of his peers because his lunch account had an outstanding balance of $4.95. In another school, a student\u2019s breakfast was thrown away due to a 30-cent debt. And one school denied a child breakfast even though the child\u2019s mother told the school over the phone that she was on her way there to pay for it.\nThese scenarios are just a few examples of lunch shaming, a practice in many schools that is intended to shame students and their parents into paying overdue meal bills to the schools.\nThe detrimental impact of lunch shaming on students extends beyond the embarrassment and indignities they experience from being treated as inferior. A lack of regular nutritious meals affects students\u2019 physical and mental health; it also impairs their cognitive ability. By examining the causes of lunch shaming, parents, educators, and policy makers can devise winning strategies to combat the practice.\n\nHow Flawed School Funding Leads to Lunch Shaming\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) free school lunch program serves 29.7 million students. Free lunches are available to students whose households have income at or below 130 percent of poverty. Reduced prices of 40 cents for lunch and 30 cents for breakfast are offered to children whose household income is between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty.\nThe American Bar Association (ABA) states that lunch shaming is the result of the way schools fund their breakfast and lunch programs. State and federal government agencies place students into two categories: those who qualify for assistance under the USDA program\u2019s guidelines and those who must pay the set price for school-provided meals.\n\n&gt;However, many students fall into a third category: their family income exceeds the thresholds set by the school lunch programs, but the families cannot afford to pay for their school meals. While every state operates some form of school lunch program, many of these programs are \u201coptional and self-supporting,\u201d according to the ABA. This prevents them from receiving government funding, although they may accept federal and state cash aid, federal commodities, and charitable donations.\n\nAlso -- and this is purely my own initial reaction, and I'm admittedly not an expert on the topic -- income relative to poverty level seems to be an arbitrary way to determine whether someone can afford school lunches. There are so many ways that other uncontrollable and unexpected situations can put families into crippling debt. A cancer diagnosis or car accident, for example. A divorce could also complicate things.\n\nMaking sure Every. Single. Child. who either cannot afford a meal or forgets their lunch or lunch money can eat is the most important factor. It may even require fewer resources to make sure everyone gets a free meal than it would to filter out those who can afford it. I don't have the data on it, but that's one of the arguments for UBI: It would cost more to limit who got it than it would to give it to everyone.","labels":"s"},{"text":"&gt; So why do you, as a Socialist, support Universal Basic Income?\n\nBecause the problem isn't, and never was, some people having nice things.\n\nThe problem socialists want to solve is Want.

It seems you're looking at it the same way many are looking at it, through the lens of employment numbers, but it's so much more than that.\n\nI've written a lot about this, and I guess I would suggest starting [here](https:\/\/medium.com\/working-life\/why-should-we-support-the-idea-of-an-unconditional-basic-income-8a2680c73dd3).\n\nTry to look at the big picture. Think of all the jobs out there that exist purely because people don't have a basic income. Then look at low unemployment again. Is that really a good indicator to use? If 100% of people are getting paid to do complete and utter bullshit, then that's a 0% unemployment rate and it's also an absurd society to any outside observer.\n\nIt is also for that reason, [I suggest looking at things from an outside perspective](http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/scott-santens\/humanity-needs-universal-_b_9599198.html)(please read link). Consider what could be different if we already had a basic income right now.\n\nImagine a country where everyone is doing a job they want to do, not one they feel forced to do. Consider an economy where all workers have the power to say no to low wages, long hours, and crappy benefits\/conditions. \n\nHow many useless jobs could be eliminated? How many more jobs could be automated if people weren't afraid of losing their entire incomes as a result. How much more productive would everyone be? How much more creativity would we see? How much more innovation would we see from so many more people feeling secure enough in their lives to take more risks? How many more new businesses would we see? How many more customers would we see for those businesses and old businesses, if people had more money to spend? How much healthier would people be? How much less crime would we see? How much happier would people be? The questions like this go on and on.\n\nDo you see what I'm getting at? Step back and look at the big picture. Don't just accept things for how they are, but try to see things as how they could be if we thought about things just a bit differently.\n\nBasic income is not just some improved safety net. It has the ability to transform entire societies for the better.\n\nSo if you have the opportunity to vote yes on June 5th, then by all means, grab that opportunity for what it is, and don't only help change Switzerland for the better, but nudge the entire world in the same direction.","labels":"s"},{"text":"I wouldn't say that it can be debunked quicker.

There have been socialist movements in nearly every country on Earth\n&gt;\n&gt;Nationalism is also extremely popular around the globe, with nationalist movements existing for every country. Does this mean everyone wants to live in repressive authoritarian ethnostates? No. Similarly not everyone who is left wants to live in a commune, I think the idea of having a house which your family lives in and a plot of land to yourself is something universally appealing to everyone who isn't a crusty looking hippy.\n\nMy point was \"not everybody wants to live in a commune\" is not a good argument when just as many people don't want to live in capitalism either. If it's wrong to make people who don't want to live in communes, how is it not wrong to force people to live in capitalism? And the record totally proves that capitalists have way more violently oppressed communists than communists have ever even come close to. Even mainstream liberal opinions mean you get violently repressed within capitalism. If you want to see how violently Capitalism has treated leftists, just look at Che Guevara, Thomas Sankara, MLK, Malcolm X, Frank Hampton, the Move bombing in Philadelphia, Salvador Allende, the current coup in Venezuela in the name of 'democracy', and many other examples.\n\nAs long as we continue to live in class society, capitalists will continue to violently destroy anything that gets in the way of profits. Even democratically elected socialists like Allende are killed and replaced with dictators time and time again, showing capitalists have no respect for the self determination of those who wish to live without it. In fact it is the natural tendency of capitalism to imperialize, and capitalists must come to control other nations in order to expand markets and better exploit cheap labor. Without that exploitation of the third world, and without expanding markets, economic growth ceases to become possible as we cease to create new demand for labor, people lose their income and stop consuming, and we fall into economic depression *precisely because* we have run out of artificial ways to force people to work to earn their right to survive.\n\nEven if you implement UBI it will be the natural tendency of capitalists to, by any means necessary, raise prices or otherwise make you spend more of your income on their product, and once again you will no longer be able to afford to survive without working and the economy will fall into depression. Even if you legislate against this, capitalists will use extra-legal means to change the rules such that you give as many of your resources to them as possible. Any type of social democracy that exists today is temporary against the natural tendency and inherent need of Capitalism to increase demand and profit, profit by definition being value created by the working class and appropriating the rich. Capitalism is impossible to reform because it is defined specifically by private individuals stealing from pools of socially produced resources.

Most if not all stances the Democrats had in the votings you provided (not considering ones that are unique to america like the impeachment or the supreme court) align themselves with the positions of mainstream conservative parties in Europe.\nThings like universal healthcare, the equality act, abortion rights, net neutrality, minimum wage and action against climate change are all position which are pretty centrist in most European countries and have already been implemented by the ruling conservative parties.\n\nAgain, the Democrats are the better choice for leftists in america, but they don't propose any distinctly leftist changes.\n\nSome examples of those would be:\n- state sponsored universal healthcare for everyone without restrictions and without out-of-pocket costs and co-pay\n- significant decrease in military spending\n- universal basic income\n- significantly higher taxes for the rich, including taxation of assets\n- increase of the minimum wage to a level that allows for the support of a family","labels":"s"},{"text":"Surprisingly, a UBI scheme of $12k \/ year and a flat tax of about 40% is actually better for the rich than just using our current tax scheme and bumping up taxes by something crazy like 75%, which seems more crazy than it is due to the $12k of tax free money coming in.\n\nSome more analysis, assuming 40% flat tax and $12k UBI - I should note that this is income post deductions, which changes the game quite a bit, I don't know how to control for that. Also, I used the Ontario tax rates:\n\n1. Crossover point where you start actually paying taxes is when you gross $30k.\n2. Crossover point where the current scheme leaves you with more money than the UBI scheme is when you gross about $54k.\n3. Crossover point where UBI + flat tax is advantageous again is at $160k.\n\nAt this point, a flat tax + ubi leaves more money in the person's pocket after tax at an increasing rate.  For example, at $175k you have 1% more money with the UBI scheme, at $200k it's more like 2.5%, and $250k it's up to about 6.3%, etc.\n\nInterestingly, just doubling taxes across the board, while maintaining the current brackets and not taxing the UBI gives us the following:\n\n1. Start actually paying taxes when grossing ~$41k\n2. More take home money until ~$62k\n3. Take home 10% less at ~$84k.  It gets significantly worse from there.\n\nIn general, I think the idea of maintaining a progressive tax is more \"income equality\" focused in general.  I don't think just doubling taxes is a good idea - what I'm trying to show is that a rejigged progressive system is better than a flat tax.  For instance, remove the the bottom bracket of 0% tax (since you're getting $12k tax free anyway) and increase taxes across the board by a lot, but at different rates per bracket (say, 200% at lower brackets and 150% at higher brackets - which again seems weird, but because the $12k UBI is a larger proportion of the income, it ends up being a lower percentage overall).\n\nIt works out well from the income equality perspective.  But I gotta say, I love that progressive structure of the flat tax.

Putting $1000 directly into the hands of every American adult is going increase our economy 10-15% alone. This is the trick-up economy, where we let Americans decide what to do with their money instead of wasting it on Government programs.\n\nAnd Yang's addresses your rent seeking capitalist scenario from [here](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/blog\/ubi_faqs\/wouldnt-cause-rampant-inflation\/):\n\n*It is likely that some companies will increase their prices in response to people having more buying power, and a VAT would also increase prices marginally. However, there will still be competition between firms that will keep prices in check. Over time, technology will continue to decrease the prices of most goods where it is allowed to do so (e.g., clothing, media, consumer electronics, etc.). The main inflation we currently experience is in sectors where automation has not been applied due to government regulation or inapplicability \u2013 primarily housing, education, and healthcare. The real issue isn\u2019t Universal Basic Income, it\u2019s whether technology and automation will be allowed to reduce prices in different sectors.*\n\n\nHere are more benefits of UBI from Yang's website:\n\n* UBI encourages people to find work. Many current welfare programs take away benefits when recipients find work, sometimes leaving them financially worse off than before they were employed. UBI is for all adults, regardless of employment status, so recipients are free to seek additional income, which most everyone does.\n* UBI reduces bureaucracy\u2014with no-strings-attached coverage, determining who is eligible is far simpler and the cost of administering benefits is greatly reduced.  \n* UBI increases bargaining power for workers because a guaranteed, unconditional income gives them leverage to say no to exploitative wages and abusive working conditions. Employers can\u2019t push workers around as much.  \n* UBI increases entrepreneurship because it provides for basic needs in the early lean days of a company and acts as a safety net if the business fails. It also gives you more consumers to sell to because everyone has more disposable income. The Roosevelt Institute found that a UBI would create 4.6 million jobs and grow the economy by 12 percent continuously. UBI would be the greatest catalyst for new jobs, entrepreneurship, and creativity we have ever seen.  \n* UBI improves the mental health of recipients because it reduces conditions of scarcity, poverty, and financial insecurity, major sources of stress for millions of people.\n* UBI helps people make smarter decisions. Studies have shown that people in straits of economic insecurity have a reduced cognitive ability equal to 13 IQ points. UBI would provide the security people need to focus on important things like their families.\n* UBI improves physical health. With increased economic security, people are less prone to stresses, disease, and self-destructive behavior. A UBI experiment in Canada saw hospitalization rates go down 8.5%.\n* UBI increases art production, nonprofit work and caring for loved ones because it provides a supplementary income for those interested in labor that isn\u2019t supported by the market.  \n* UBI improves labor market efficiency because fewer workers are stuck in jobs that are a bad fit. National productivity will improve because people will be able to seek work that is more rewarding and promote higher job satisfaction.\n* UBI improves relationships by reducing domestic violence, child abuse, financial stresses, and sources of conflict. It ensures that everyone has an optimistic sense of his or her own future and has the mobility to get out of abusive relationships.","labels":"s"},{"text":"minority rights - too divisive to bring up during an election because you will offend the economically anxious rust belt types.\n\nUBI - the country is ready!!!\n\n","labels":"s"},{"text":"i wouldnt really called [100+ policies with descriptions of each](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/policies\/) \u2014 many of which he\u2019s discussed further in interviews\/social media \u2014 \u201cvague\u201d.\n\nalso, as per [the UBI page on his site](https:\/\/www.yang2020.com\/what-is-freedom-dividend-faq\/) notes that social security would stack with UBI. hence why its a *universal* basic income.","labels":"s"},{"text":"&gt; I\u2019ve a couple thousand short pieces there on Medium.

This means that less money will circulate in the hands of workers compared to in the hands of capitalists, which thus drives the purchasing power of workers down, since the price of every commodity still consists of both the profits going to the capitalist and the wages going to the workers (and the money that the means of production costed). \n\nTake a look at this.

C being the money invested in means of production that went into producing the commodity, v being the money invested in wages that went into producing the commodity, and s being the profit that goes to the capitalist. We can see that the price of the commodity can stay the same if we change the ratio between s and v. Because the ratio changes, the purchasing power of the workers will decrease. This stays true when the price decreases while the ratio s\/v increases. \n\nExample: \n\nt=0 gives c + v + s = 20 + 10 + 10 = 40$ and s\/v = 10\/10 = 1\n\nt=1 gives c + v + s = 20 + 5 + 10 = 35$ and s\/v = 10\/5 = 2\n\nIn t=0, the worker could afford 1\/4th of this commodity. \n\nIn t=1, the worker could afford 1\/7th of this commodity.\n\nThus the purchasing power of the worker has fallen, despite the falling of the price. \n\n&gt;Yes\n\nWhy not nationalize the robots and make the fully automated produced goods free instead of paying people a UBI?","labels":"a"},{"text":"I think I understand your argument a bit better - in that politicians are essentially a \"waste of space\" if they are on the debate stage without winning potential.\n\nI dont think you have a great solution - in that it creates more litmus tests for who is allowed to be given a voice to run for president. \n\nPeople already feel like both parties prevent them from having a voice in politics. \n\nIf debates are what youre annoyed about maybe the solution would be fixing the debates - like having 3 or 4 candidates sit down at a time, or having \"just the plans\" debates where candidates are only allowed to submit video responses as to why their plan for particular issues is best - like guns, Healthcare, immigration...\n\nThere's room for improvement, and I think fixing the debates would be better than preventing politicians without political connections from having a voice.\n\nWe unquestionably need more voices in politics.

It's A big issue, yes, but I wouldn't say it's the biggest. \n\nThe biggest issue is that universal basic income, if implemented fully, is philosophically so close to serfdom that it is effectively the same system. \n\nIn a 100% UBI society except for some top echelon of rich people who pay for it without needing it you literally have a caste society, with most people living in a UBI bubble off of basic subsistence need and paying for products produced by a small elite of very rich people who own the capital of the businesses that make products or arrange services. \n\nThe myth of UBI is that it will \"empower the poor to seek success\" but literally the exact same thing has been said with all welfare systems. It does this for some small number of people, yes. And temporary unemployment insurance to aid in people who lose their jobs while they hunt down another has been demonstrated to be very effective a measure in keeping people stable during employment gaps. \n\nPast that, welfare is a motivation trap. If a household is on it too long, children grow up completely dependent on it and learn to never seek employment. You get multiple generations of welfare dependency and create welfare aculturation. Entire sectors of society where the idea of on the books above board work is anathema. These people tend to never get off the dole and often turn to crime (since hey, black market risks are equal and gains made won't be reported anyway). \n\nUnfortunately, most people do not have the right mindset to take handouts effectively. I'm not even elevating myself here. When I've been unemployed and I received assistance, I sat on my ass. When that assistance was cut off, I moved and found work. \n\nIt's a natural state of humanity to seek an efficient way of expending our energy. It will always be more efficient to spend very little energy and reduce your living costs and footprint if you free money for no effort than it will be to work hard enough to exceed your costs. That's basic calculation. UBI makes that an easy choice to make.\n\nAnd once enough people are hooked onto mass state welfare, well then everyone's dependent on the state and you can say goodbye to any kind of real freedom. You have to be either a communist, a monarchist, or a lover of slavery to think this a good system.\n\nThis isn't to diminish the issue of inflation. That's a huge issue.

The idea behind minimum wage is that a person with a full-time job (or, more accurately, who works full-time) should be able to afford a 'decent' standard of living. The UBI, once fully in-force, would provide most of that. If a person can live 'okay' without working, the minimum compensation needed from working is actually zero.\n\nI keep hearing this line of reasoning, and I have to disagree. You need to understand the motivations of business. They're there to make profits. Their goal, as far as employment goes, is to hire the fewest amount of people at he lowest wages to do the least amount of work. ANd seeing how to get more income than UBI has to offer, you need a job, it seems counterproductive to eliminate the minimum wage. Rather, you're throwing people in the same situation they're in now. Quite frankly, I'd like to see a minimum wage hike if we cant get UBI passed, but seeing how that would be more disruptive than UBI, wouldnt be a good idea. Honestly, to reach a real \"living wage\", you need minimum wage AND UBI. Or two people making UBI.

Savings from other programs and raising new revenue. \n\nA big concept of the freedom dividend is its savings front. E.g. someone that leaves jail will get $1k\/mo which is a highly appealing alternative given that their options usually are struggle to find a job or commit a crime and go back to guaranteed food\/shelter\/etc. Re-incarceration rates are pretty high which is not good for a country with high incarceration rates. Then there will be natural welfare consolidation. Administering cashlike benefits like SNAP etc are huge money pits in regards to helping people and the amount of administration overhead especially because politicians love to means test. All that really means is that to eliminate a small possibility of abuse, they want to add a fixed amount of guaranteed inefficiency. Usually, this doesn't solve the problem either... Either way these changes should add up to substantial savings at the cost of smaller government. \n\nAdditional money for the dividend will be raised through a wealth redistribution mechanism. Wealth taxes are notoriously difficult to execute so you really have 3 options: sales, income, or property. Property taxes are difficult to calculate. Income taxes could work but the richest people can deduct their way out. Thus, you're left with sales tax (sales tax being the ELI5 friendly term. There is a huge difference with how a VAT actually works). Yang proposes a 10% VAT and european countries are at 20%. For a majority of american citizens, there is no way we would spend more than $10k\/mo\/person which is how much would need to be spent to be &gt; 10% of tax even if you include every single possible transaction (some will be tax free just like how our current sales tax works). Thus, a majority of america will benefit greatly from the $1k\/mo. \n\nHowever, if you think about who will pay greatly from a sales tax perspective, its not people per se. It's business. Flights, commercial properties, etc. Businesses will be paying significantly into a VAT system and this is what Yang means when a behemoth like amazon can deduct their income taxes to 0 but will HAVE to pay VAT due to the expenses incurred during business operation. The humorous thing is that its not clear whether their profits will decrease as giving americans $1k\/mo will significantly increase buying power.

Why do people who not work get that money but working people don't. People who work for lower wages pay fortunes in housing, commuting, childcare, and give up 40+ hours a week. And for what, to end up with about as much disposable income as people who don't work? Fuck that. How's that fair?\n\nThat's the problem. Benefits are calculated to be basically the very minimum someone can survive on. And the minimum wage is calculated to be ... basically the very minimum someone can survive on.\n\nAll benefits should be universal. That's fair.

More successful businesses means a boost to the economy.\n\n**3) UBI also helps get people working.** \n\nMany people don't want work because if they take it they lose their benefits, and if the job doesn't work out ( bearing in mind they will often start on zero hours temporary contracts) it'll take months to get back on benefits. Not worth the risk. With UBI, some long term unemployed could take a Xmas job to fund some presents, or just test the water of going back to work, risk free.\n\n**4) UBI gives employers access to more flexible staff**\n\nOne of the big struggles for seasonal businesses is having staff when you need them and giving everyone hours when it's quiet. UBI makes it more possible for employees to flex down hours, and as mentioned above, should make more casual labour available.\n\n**5) UBI increases spending in the economy**\n\nPoorer people spend a greater proportion of their income. Wealthy people hoard money. Put money in lower earners pockets and they will spend it at a greater rate than the wealthy do. That spending will grow sales in businesses, creating more work and more tax receipts.\n\n**6) UBI will reduce the costs of government spending.**\n\nCrime and poor health are directly linked to poverty. Less people in poverty, less people scraping by, means less strain on police and the NHS.\n\nWhat's more, UBI means we can bin a big department of civil servants who currently administer benefits. So more tax to invest elsewhere.\n\n**7) UBI will make our future workforce smarter.**\n\nSuccess in education is directly linked to income level. Less people in poverty or scraping by means our future generations will be better equipped to join the workforce or to start their own business. Higher quality workers and entrepreneurs means more tax receipts.\n\nSo all this extra working and spending; a bigger, better educated, more flexible workforce; lower government costs; UBI is a capitalist dream.

With a UBI, you remove the income tax allowance, so you pay income tax on every pound you earn, as there is no need to have an allowance when you're being given money in the first place.

Every citizen would have the same amount of money in the end and the government would be paying the same amount out.\n\nThe difference between the two becomes more apparent when you think about moving away from income tax.

The clear and obvious solution to this problem is Land Value Taxation, as not only do you get the normal benefits of LVT by removing any excess burden of taxation, you also end up with a system which will work just as well regardless of the level of automation in society. LVT will work perfectly for as long as there will be human civilisation on celestial bodies.

If we get to that point, then everything we are able to do can and probably will be replaced by machines. What about jobs? How will the economy work? More importantly, who's going to be running these machines? \n\nAll serious concerns, and more importantly if things just continue like business as usual then the concept of small groups or even individuals owning mass automation becomes a very serious threat to society. Without outside intervention we can make some basic assumptions about how things might play out as the level of automation increases. If general purpose robotics become common place and progressively cheaper the lowest level jobs will be consumed by automation first and will only continue to encroach on increasingly sophisticated trades. Where that leaves us is will a few people at the top of a company based almost entirely on automation and a litany of unemployed people. This will break the current economy.\n\nAt this point I find many people asking themselves how we could just stop this automation from happening. You might be tempted to argue that we could use legislation to prevent people from automating and culling the workforce, but then we are presented with even bigger problems. If a company can accomplish a task with virtually zero expenses with automation, but a governing body has implemented a ban on automation, we're simply driving automation underground or abroad. If we don't do it someone else will. If one country bans automation but others allow it then our trade deficit will just explode, or we stop trading altogether. Both of these situations have horrible consequences for the group that bans automation. Anyone using automation becomes a threat to the status quo. Many companies are already multinational organizations, one government can't realistically control these entities, and any group that embraces automation will become an economic powerhouse relative to any country with mandated reliance on human labor.\n\n&gt;Do you not want to have the ability to rise through hard work? Would you rather have everyone be equal? \n\nIf the work can all be done by machines with virtually zero effort then it becomes somewhat of a moot point. Labor for labors sake is no way of life. Rationalizing this situation as everyone simply being equal ignores what much of this automation brings to the table. In western society most everyone has equal access to water, mass automation will simply bring the bare necessities of life up to the same level of things like water, most people wouldn't argue the merits of providing equal access to clean water. How people choose to advance themselves has been and always will be up to themselves. Learning more, being useful, applying yourself to what you find interesting will always be what driven people do, but if we have the capability to provide the basics to everyone with zero effort on any humans part then we should, for the same reasons we think we should provide drinking water. Monetary gain has always been secondary to the work that people do and has only been and end onto itself for people who don't believe in what they are doing. Embracing the idea that menial jobs don't need to be done by people simply liberates people to branch out into things they actually care about instead of working out of necessity.\n\nAt the end of the day all these changes leave a huge portion of society not being directly needed to keep society running. Regardless of how this happens, when it does we need a safety net for the millions of people who become unemployable. This is why talks about universal basic income have become so prevalent, and the most logical way to make the economics work for this idea are to tax automation.\n\nEdit: I was a little rushed towards the end of writing this so just cleaned it up.","labels":"s"},{"text":"\u201cSomething this complex\u201d - really?\n\nOur government has been trying to pull off the welfare system for decades now, and that\u2019s way more complex.

Yang's policies are overwhelmingly corporate and authoritarian.     \n.    \n\nAndrew Yang not only wants to massively deregulate corporations; he wants to do it automatically by sunsetting regulations.  That's a more extreme, Republican stance than any other candidate has, including Trump.   Yang is also a privatizer in every area of policy. He supports Biden and Trump's predatory trade deals, including the investor-state dispute provisions that give corporations power over sovereign governments and have been called a step toward corporate dictatorship. Yang both attacks public education and wants to limit access to college by curtailing federal student loans. He opposes almost all of Bernie's agenda, including the federal minimum wage, a Green New Deal, free tuition at public colleges, and even a wealth tax. He opposes public financing of elections. And he not only will retain the unconstitutional Patriot Act and its secret laws and courts and mass surveillance, but he also proposes new authoritarian policies that would expand terrorism laws' reach of Americans, monitor American behavior with a \"social credit\" system, shape media narratives, and attack freedom of speech and social media online.  \n\nYang lied for over a year claiming to support single-payer healthcare, and the plan he finally released is more conservative than Biden's. It doesn't even have a public option. Yet he continued to deceive voters by labeling his policy healthcare page with the name of Bernie's single-payer plan. You have to read past the huge, misleading \"Medicare for All\" headline and four paragraphs down before he admits he does not support single-payer, and you then have to click on a link to find his actual plan, which merely continues Obamacare and promises to \"explore\" the possibility of a public option later.\n\nAnd Yang's UBI isn't even progressive. It forces people to give up the social welfare benefits they have. It cannot exceed those benefits; PLUS, it is funded with a regressive tax that hits the poor hardest. As a result, the poor can actually come away poorer than they were with than without Yang's UBI.           \n.    \n\nSo....Yang ramps up all the policies that have impoverished Americans and then promises that giving us all $1000 a month somehow will help us, even while he is proposing further deregulation, privatization, predatory trade deals, and authoritarianism. If there were a recipe for continuing the spiral into corporate domination and authoritarianism this nation has experienced since 9\/11, Yang's policy agenda is that recipe.    \n\nYet he is weirdly celebrated as a progressive in a relentless, daily push online.       \n\nThink about that. And look at his policies. Follow the links in my post history documenting all this.

A loaf of bread may be worth say 3 arrows but if the bread guy has arrows then you have to find something he needs capitalism finds a work around thru currency curacy builds exchange extra. markets develop. \n\n&gt;At one time the divine right of kings was unchangeable. \n\nyeah at the same time as the silk road and the massive Asian, middle eastern, African, and Norse trading routs. you know capitalism...\n\n&gt;When the stakes are the highest stakes-- people being able to live dignified lives, we haven't gotten there until we've gotten there. But it's dumb hubris to pretend capitalism is the end goal of human civilization. \n\nno the end goal of human civilization is the end goal of any civilization. general overpopulation until the inevitable heat death of the universe. if you think there's a plan you don't understand biology.\n\n&gt;It's a total mess. Maybe it's the WORD socialism you think you can easily dismiss, but people deserve to live better lives and benefit from their labor, instead of having it stolen by capitalist. \n\nif people are stealing your labor it's your fault for either under valuing your self or not acquiring skills that are in demand enough to stay ahead of the curve. choices matter in life I know that all too well.\n\n&gt;The idea that providing people's needs makes them lazy and stagnant is a false one.\n\ncitation needed.

I didn't go back and read things it's been a month. but UH is a good idea but i think you should be able to opt out if you want but you can't get benefits if you do.\n\n&gt;But what's worse is this idea that a human being can be judged based on their economic worth-- that's the nugget at the center of this argument. That a person less able to produce wealth for a capitalist has less moral worth in our society.\n\nI mean it's a little weird that you are adding a moral component to this whole thing. See in my world it's not a moral issue. people are free to choose their own path and their choices dictate their own lives. they are born into a system and they have to navigate it accordingly and some have a bit more luck then others because the universe is random and horrifying. there really is no plan in place for this shit man. I didn't do this to you. god didn't do this to you. your parents didn't do this to you. it was the luck of the draw and you were lucky that you were born in a western industrialized nation and you can be thankful for your blessings or you can focus on the fact that some people are born unlucky. sucks but its true. But you can help them if you work hard and find a way to raise capital and maybe just maybe you can go to them and say hey here is some shit or you can become powerful and raise them up live your dreams. the fuck is wrong with you. stop bitching and do the thing. you don't need others to do it for you you need to do it and show them the was the power to change the world is in you do it.\n\n&gt;Lets stick on this for a moment. We pretend capitalism reward value, but it doesn't. The things we all know we should value-- childcare, elder care, a sanitary and clean environment, the food we eat, our teachers-- these are all some of the worst compensated careers. Meanwhile, bankers and landlords and owners of corporations who's own work simply involves the siphoning away of money from workers-- these make up some of the most wealthy in our society. \n\n\nInvestment bankers do because they help people grow their money by telling them what companies are going to go well by doing research others don't want to do and getting a percentage of the money it's a job. people who work at backs get paid dick. also if you are a shit investment banker you get paid dick because you don't make other people money. It's like playing a slot machine for a guy with no arms and if it hits you get to keep some of the quarters. \nLand lords are allowing you to live in their home for an agreed upon price. they didn't force you in to their home at gun point. you went and looked at it said it was nice and decided that the price was worth paying. that is the value you agreed that it was worth that is how rent works. this is not a hard concept. you should not rent your whole life it should be a temporary thing. \nowners of corporations own buildings and equipment. these things require maintenance, electricity, spare parts, etc. the logistics of witch are dealt with by upper management early on the owner of the business until he has paid his dues and can hire someone to do that job for them. they do not own work they own the building blocks of a business all of these things come together to make it work. and if they need a labor force someone comes in and negotiates a price for their labor and if that labor is low skill the labor pool is high and the wage is low. this is simple economic theory. \n\nNow I'm not saying that teachers and farmers and childcare workers shouldn't be paid more because frankly children need a stable environment to become good people but you really don't seem to grasp how these other jobs work.\n\n&gt;I agree with your last sentence, and with occupy not working. That's why we need systems and technology. Occupy was a complicated interesting little chapter, but it falls into the \"folk politics\" category. That's what socialism is for. Organizing as workers in solidarity to win actual progress. Where do you think 40 hour work weeks came from? Where do you think OT pay came from? Socialists. \n\nOver worked and under paid people? Not necessarily . Not all unions were socialists. and many of the teamsters would have most likely hit you for saying that.\n\n&gt;What choice do workers actually have? You may be able to go back to school or not work full-time for two years, most workers in the United States cannot afford something like that. And that's always the argument in America, that if you work hard you, too, can become a capitalist! But succeeding would simply mean benefiting from the labor of other workers-- it's not really YOU succeeding at all. This is really the most important point here, I think. This is what capitalism does to our brains, I have the same experience. With a bit of privilege, succeeding in the US is definitely possible. But what about kids who go to under-funded schools? Who can't afford higher education? We know poverty is a cycle. The lower you are economically, the less likely you are to move to a different economic category. The idea that the United States is the land of opportunity is an illusion. It's a land of opportunity-- given your parents made a certain amount of money themselves. The CEOs that started from nothing-- frequently if you dig in they either actually started in an upper-middle-class setting, or are extremely extremely rare. You simple can't fix poverty through hard work. People who work deserve more of the wealth that they themselves create with their labor. That's really the core thing I believe. It's not an attachment to socialism as a label. I have been poor, and have been friends with people who have even less. Poor people work harder than capitalists, it's a fact. And are compensated orders of magnitude less to show for it. Capitalism does not work.\n\nI am going to school because I keep my grade point average at a level that i get in state tuition. anyone of any economic standing can do it that is why its there. I like in a basement and use food stamps to eat I bum rides to get where I'm going and i mend my clothing when need be. I do odd jobs when i can to make what little money I can those are the options I have those are the options any of us have use the social programs afforded to us. Social programs are great but full on central planning never works.

There are a lot of similarities between the Paul and Bernie campaigns, even right down to the establishment (Romney and Clinton) obstructing the Paul\/Bernie supporters at the conventions. A lot of the same exact things happened to the Paul and Bernie supporters. Why was Bernie far more popular than Ron Paul? Both were considered somewhat fringe, both attracted the youth, both had potshot accusations that the other side tried to trump up, both had extremely passionate supporters that believed in \"the cause,\" and both were old white dudes. The difference is in political ideology. Sanders promotes expanded social programs which means people are not actually stepping up individually by paying their own way. Maybe the American taxpayer is stepping up, but that's the issue. American taxpayers can't afford to \"step up\" to pay for all these social programs, even if the billionaires are chipping in. The national debt is in the trillions. Who is going to pay that off? Ron Paul's message on the other hand was the direct opposite. Stop funding wars, stop funding social programs, take personal responsibility for your own life and stop relying on the government to solve your problems. Relatively speaking, that was far more unpopular than Bernie's message and even seen as coldhearted because it would mean cutting funding for a lot of programs and deregulating. \n\nI think the reason Bernie didn't get as much support as more centrist candidates is because a lot of centrist middle class voters pay a lot in taxes and Bernie was scaring them, even if part of his message was that the wealthier would pay more. I wouldn't shame them for this. We have a huge military that we support. This is the difference between the US and other more socialist countries. They can afford more social programs because they are not financing the biggest military machine on earth.\n\nThe issue you are addressing is complicated, but I would not characterize it as people not wanting to hear a message of people not wanting to be told what to do.

The reason why it is such a big deal is because this exponential growth is still occurring. Can you imagine not having a computer now? The people in the 90's could and hell a lot of people in the 2000's could too! Try applying to job without a computer now. THAT is the exponential growth that has caused this sort of panic and saying that its the same as before is disingenuous, at best.\n\nI really don't understand this point, we've been having exponential growth for the last 50 years but now all of a sudden it's a problem? You could have said the same thing 20 years ago that oh this exponential growth is gonna result in massive unprecedented job loss soon but it hasn't. You say it's different now because suddenly everyone needs a computer but that's our reality now and the unemployment rate was low before covid. Clearly computers haven't caused unprecedented job loss yet and you can't know that it'll happen before exponential growth slows down.\n\n&gt;You're right but the unemployment  rate is not the best indicator of quality of life. The work has moved  elsewhere but I'd ask for you to think what happened to those  communities where those jobs reigned supreme. Those who could move out  and strike out for better jobs did but those that couldn't were left in a  place that was as destitute as them. The loss of manufacturing crippled  America both politically and economically, look at places like Detroit  who still haven't recovered from this. One of Trump's main points was a  (false) promise to bring back these jobs. Doesn't that say something  drastic about what the loss of these jobs led to?\n\nSure it sucks in places where the industry has dried up but that's not really anything new. Also the loss of manufacturing hasn't crippled America politically and economically the economy really hasn't been that bad before corona and I really don't think American politics are uniquely bad right now. \n\n&gt;*However*, ask any respected  economist about the affect of AI on the workplace in 10-20 years; I  guarantee you most  of their answers will range from worried uncertainty  to exactly what I've been saying.\n\nI don't think it's unreasonable to be worried, AI will absolutely have an impact on the workforce and that's something we need to keep in mind. I just don't think it's some unique problem now like you make it out to be.\n\n&gt;Tech startups don't need hundreds of people; places like Microsoft  doesn't need hundreds of employees at every office. We are becoming more  and more efficient as a society; we don't have the capacity(or need) to  keep creating more and more jobs like this.\n\nWe've been growing more efficient as a society for hundreds of years, every time we become more efficient the quality of life just goes up and demand for other jobs increases and the jobs get filled. It's not like now we're going to automate more stuff become more efficient and just maintain our current quality of life but just have less people working. \n\nI feel like one good point you made is that it's different from when we transition from farming to industry because we don't have low skilled jobs to replace the low skilled jobs.

Share holders will not exist and the means to produce value will be owned by workers collectively. 3) All workers must have the opportunity to work and to better themselves.\n\nSo what this means is that no, not everyone will make the same income and no socialist society has done this. Instead, workers will earn based on their productivity without any of that going to a business owner. There are ideas that are UBI similar (such as a \"salarie di vie\" which is a french originating idea where everyone gets a basic salary that rises with experience), and other ideas such as a job guarantee (everyone is guaranteed to get a job that can support themselves and those who excel can get more). This does also mean that jobs that take more effort to do and learn and which are more important to encourage people to do will make a higher salary. Generally however, the education to get these better jobs is free and just limited by willingness\/ability to go through tough schooling.\n\nThis does reduce inequality, because the range of productivity between people is no where near as big as capitalism allows. In capitalism extreme inequality happens because they hire workers paying them less than the worker produces, and taking a profit. That is why share holders or business owners cannot be allowed in a socialist country.\n\nSo I hope this helps answer your question, but there's also a lot of links to good resources on the sub home page for further reading if that helps!","labels":"n"},{"text":"Sure, which is why I don't think a UBI will lead to widespread laziness.

The existence of public transit or bicycling as an alternative doesn't contradict what I'm saying, nor does the cultural value of leisure driving and travel. \n\nI'd like it if you reflected on my second-job thought experiment.

It is also a very dangerous idea. Other people might get the idea that they should have a choice about how they spend their lives based on things that they value and are important to them.\n\nThe issue being that when an entire social class of millions choose to spend their lives contributing in no material way to society, the rest of us *do* carry the burden.  We carry it in the length of army service terms, in the tax rates we have to pay, in the lower incomes available to even the most skilled among us because of how low Israel's productivity is in-general, in receiving fewer and inferior social services.\n\nI'm a full-scale socialist, but even under socialism, at some point you have only two choices: you can *either* force the Haredim into the proletariat, *or* you can switch the entire basis of the current welfare state from poverty-line necessities to a fixed redistribution of available wealth as a basic income.  If you switch to the latter model, I support that, but the basic income will be lower than is necessary to support those large Haredi families, in fact often lower than is necessary to support one unemployed man.\n\nSo either way, the Haredim should not be able to coast along spending their lives on Torah while the rest of us work to support them and serve in the army defending them.

This conflict lessens the fairness of the UBI.\n\nIf you already know users are unique individuals through your verification process, and the people running nodes in your consensus network will be drawn from those users, then you can use a different protocol that doesn't need proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.

People worry about inflation, but as long as the currency has a place to go (e.g. vendors and exchanges--also see below about land rent), it benefits the currency's economy by creating a wealth redistribution in conjunction with the basic income: the current holders of the currency essentially pay a tax to everyone equally.

I been renting my whole life and it fucking sucks. I give a third of my income away so someone can essentialy do nothing and retain the right to the property. I've literally paid other peoples mortgages and i have nothing to show for it. \n\ni live in major urban area, new housing isn't always an option, new apartments near downtown are often gentrified with high price tags, affordable homes are often much farther away requiring up to a 2 hour commute in rush hour traffic one way. that means your spending 12 hours of your time for 8 hours of pay just to own a home. Unfortunately, housing costs are so high that an addition of $1000 income wont be enough to buy rather than rent for the vast majority of low income earners. \n\nthe best possibility for me owning a home within a reasonable commute to work, would be if the UBI was insistuted and million others just like me arent trying to do the exact same thing driving up demand. that means i cannot wait for it to go into effect i got to place a bid on a home, hopefully before they even sign the bill. \n\nevery industry has people to analyze markets and demographics to find how much money different people have and where they are spending it. so they are well aware of how people in my situation might respond. \n\ni remember attending corporate conferences back when just before Obama-care came out. They were extremely excited and happy over the fact that an otherwise untapped market was suddenly going to spend billions of dollars on health-care. Now i don't mean that it came out of pocket, it was the government who provided the billions. a literal subsidy. \n\nDespite doing some good for alot of people, Obama-care didn't resolve a number of major issues people were relying on to do so. Health care is still an problem. Similary, UBI will have a similar impact on afford-housing, however it will still be an problem. \n\nSo i'm basically modelling my predictions for UBI based on my experiences with Obama-care. But instead of a direct or literaly subsidy, it is a indirect  or virtual subsidy. Subsidies don't always make things cheaper like they should, it depends on context and oversight. \nUBI and Obama-care have different mechanisms but essentially the same effect, that is i think landlords, banks, and the housing market will do quite well due to UBI much like pharmaceuticals, healthcare providers and insurance companies did due to Obama. but you'll probably disagree, and that's ok. maybe you will be right idk.","labels":"s"},{"text":"&gt;  This disconnect leads to a lot of misunderstandings (Republicans looking at Dems as socialists, Dems looking at Reps as white nationalists).

Big systems that decide for the citizen who needs help, what that help should be like, where that help is available etc, can be really great when they work, and I wouldn't be surprised to find that they are MORE EFFICIENT when they are at their best than UBI will be on average, but when those systems fail for some reason, the failure is often not one that can be remedied, and it's not just creating a gap in assistance that may be terminal, but it's soul crushing to run into that, whereas if you make a mistake with your monthly UBI, you can learn from that and try again next month, and every month you become a better citizen, a better advocate for yourself, and do better and better with those resources, which is not only uplifting, but really helps prepare people for the ways they will have to act in life to be successful in many arenas, and it never punishes them or writes them off if they need to take a break from trying to improve themselves, or working hard, or if a wrench gets thrown in the gears because a loved one died or a tragedy struck the community.

Simply put, raising children in an intellectually stimulating environment produces children which are, on average, more intellectual (but there will always be intellectually inferior outliers). Raising children in a deprived environment produces children which are, on average, less intelligent (though again, with highly intelligent outliers). Increasing educational attainment begins with increasing access to that education.

I know you've used a self-checkout at a store, and probably used them at McDonald's too. Efficiency and automation will leave us all unemployed eventually, it might take 20,30,50,100 years, but the robots are absolutely coming for the majority of jobs, if they haven't already. I'm not fearmongering, it's just an uncomfortable fact. Think about how much software\/electronics you use at work. Think about how many people would have been needed to do your job just as quickly as you can 100 years ago without those tools.

Mutualism is above all an ethical philosophy, not an economic or political one. It merely leads us towards some *general* political and economic positions so long as those positions rest within the moral frame work.\n\nWe *tend* to be free market socialists because free market socialism is a best representation of a mutually beneficial relationship based on the Golden Rule. One can be completely communist and a mutualist if that ethical philosophy leads them to conclude that communism is the best method to attain a higher moral standard between affected parties; they're rare but they exist. \n\nThis is why we are inevitably completely anti-State *and* anti-Capitalism because there's nothing mutually beneficial about hierarchal top-down relationships.

It could be a variety of unions depending on the nature of the property. Quite frankly, the more splintered the various trade unions the better (and by splintered I do not mean opposing).\n\nThey would be able to hold public auctions for leases over various properties. A natural equilibrium would be found in time between the cost of the lease as well as the time frame; thus the beauty of markets. Private developers would be influenced to develop their respective properties to match their own demands as well as be able to hold onto subsequent leases.\n\nI feel that a \"first come first served\" policy should be in place that allows existing owners first dibs to renew the lease before it is put up for public bid. It just makes sense. Kind of like how sports stars are able to renegotiate longer contracts when they get toward the end of their existing contract before they opt to go into free agency. It does put a little interest on maintaining properties.\n\n&gt;Say I wanted to temporarily rent a field for whatever reason, who would I get in contact with and who would I pay?\n\nDepending on the nature of the property, the respective union that operates that kind of property. Is it a farm? Farmer's union. Is it a house? Homebuilder's union.\n\nIdeally, these would primarily be taken care of through the Syndicate; the meeting of all the affected unions.

If you listen to Yang speak he is clearly someone who is forthright and honest (i.e. he actually considers things as opposed to just being driven by ideology).  This UBI question also goes hand-in-hand with the coming automation age.  \n\nWith that said I think he is significantly downplaying how complicated, expensive, and prone to unintended side effects this could be.  Its a bit ironic but in a lot of ways the thing that makes the most sense in my mind is for the USA and EU to agree to some kind of test case.  Maybe all contribute slightly to fund a UBI for the UK or something where we have a few tens of millions of people and we can see what the effects of it would be more broadly.  Then you could make a more convincing case for the tradeoffs that would have to come with implimenting a UBI that was supposed to be funded completely by the nation running it.","labels":"n"},{"text":"The secrets Are still out there.

Using LVT to fund UBI eliminates that dynamic. \n\nBut look, if this is about homesteading, you can use UBI to pay rent on a fairly large piece of land and raise food or whatever for yourself.

Instead of 44k a year per person, let's bring it down to 20k a year per person(which is certainly more reasonable seeing as the point of UBI is to provide basic needs without having to work.) Reduce spending on other areas, like military which takes a very disproportional amount of money compared to what we actually should be spending on military. Welfare and Medicaid systems will be gone since UBI will cover that. And then finally we can rescale our tax system to take more from big business and anyone who makes more than, let's say, a million dollars per year. As businesses start to automate their jobs and in doing so providing less jobs for the people, they should be expected to take a higher tax rate to help the people that no longer have a job. \n\nI think in order to survive the mass unemployment that automation will bring, we have to conform to the idea that we must take some of the wealth from the top, and spread it to the common people. Even if some people find it \"unfair\" and \"these companies earned their money, why should we give it to people who don't even work\", it may be our only option to prevent mass starvation.\n\nUltimately if we look ahead to the far future, this period of UBI will be temporary. As technology progresses we become exponentially smarter than we are now, and things like wealth distribution and consumerism will be words in a history book, as society realizes how superficial it really all is.\n\nIt will be tricky to find the funding for UBI, I agree with you there. But as the cost of living decreases with the growth in technology, people will be getting more for less, and in the future it might be extremely easy to provide a comfortable living for everyone.\n\nOr it might not, which is why we should discuss it now rather than later, when it could be too late.\n\nNinja edit: sorry for the rambling, might have gone a little off topic.","labels":"s"},{"text":"&gt; 90% of the population hate their jobs. Wouldn't you say that this is a systemic issue rather than \"just life\"?

The scale of that war as much about technology, society having no precedent for how to handle the technology, and human societies coming to the realization that war on that scale is not desirable.\n\n To me it seems fairly obvious what is actually going to happen is the same as any other industrial revolution.
